#### Pull Request Guidelines

**Title Format**:

- `fix: [Notebook XX] Description` - Bug fix
- `docs: [Notebook XX] Description` - Documentation improvement
- `feat: [Notebook XX] Description` - New content/example
- `chore: Description` - Maintenance tasks

**Description**:

- What changed?

- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Tested in Codespaces OR locally

### Code Style

**Notebooks**:

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add markdown cells explaining complex code
- Keep code cells focused (one concept per cell)
- Include expected output in markdown

**Python Code**:

- Follow PEP 8 (enforced by Black)
- Use type hints where helpful
- Add docstrings for functions

**Markdown**:

- Use headers hierarchically (##, ###, ####)
- Include code fences with language tags
- Keep line length reasonable (~80-100 chars)

### Adding New Content

#### New Notebook

To propose a new notebook:

1. Open a discussion first (gauge interest)
2. Provide outline:
   - Learning objectives
   - Topics covered
   - Estimated time
   - Prerequisites
3. Wait for maintainer feedback
4. Create notebook in appropriate directory:
   - `notebooks/foundations/` - Generic LangGraph
   - `notebooks/firewall_workshop/` - PAN-OS specific
5. Follow existing notebook structure:
   - Title cell
   - Learning objectives
   - Prerequisite check
   - Concept sections with examples
   - Exercises
   - Summary
6. Add entry to `Makefile` and `README.md`

#### New Example

To add an example to existing notebook:

1. Ensure it teaches the target concept clearly
2. Use realistic but simple scenario
3. Include:
   - Problem statement
   - Code implementation
   - Expected output
   - Key takeaways
4. Test thoroughly

### Testing Requirements

All PRs must pass:

1. **Notebook Execution**: All affected notebooks run without errors
2. **Output Cleaning**: Notebooks committed with clean outputs
3. **Documentation**: README and guides reflect changes

### Review Process

1. Maintainer reviews PR (usually within 7 days)
2. Feedback provided if changes needed
3. Once approved, maintainer merges
4. Your contribution is live! 🎉
