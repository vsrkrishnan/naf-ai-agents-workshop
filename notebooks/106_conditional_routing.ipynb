    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Notebook 106! In previous notebooks, you learned to build sequential workflows where state flows linearly from one node to the next. But real-world network automation often requires **decision-making** - routing workflows down different paths based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Conditional Routing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional routing** allows your LangGraph workflows to make intelligent decisions about which path to take based on the current state. Instead of following a fixed sequence, your graph can branch into different paths depending on conditions you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about common SCM automation scenarios:\n",
    "- **IF** folder is \"Production\" **THEN** require approval workflow **ELSE** create directly\n",
    "- **IF** address type is \"ip_netmask\" **THEN** validate CIDR format **ELSE IF** type is \"fqdn\" **THEN** validate DNS format\n",
    "- **IF** firewall has HA enabled **THEN** check HA sync status **ELSE** skip HA checks\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what conditional routing enables!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Without conditional routing:\n",
    "- All workflows follow the same path regardless of conditions\n",
    "- No way to handle different scenarios (dev vs prod, HA vs standalone)\n",
    "- Logic becomes complex with nested if/else statements in nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "With conditional routing:\n",
    "- Workflows adapt intelligently based on state\n",
    "- Clear visual representation of decision points\n",
    "- Clean separation between routing logic and processing logic\n",
    "- Easy to add new paths or modify routing conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!"

    "## 2. Journey So Far\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap what you've learned in the previous notebooks to understand where conditional routing fits:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook 103: State & Reducers\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned that **state** is the foundation of LangGraph applications:\n",
    "- Defined using `TypedDict` for type safety\n",
    "- Flows through the entire workflow, accessible to all nodes\n",
    "- Updated by nodes using **reducers** to merge changes\n",
    "- Can track complex data like lists of SCM objects, validation errors, and API responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept**: State is your application's memory - it persists throughout the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook 104: Sequential Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned to build **linear workflows** with nodes and edges:\n",
    "- Created nodes as processing functions that update state\n",
    "- Connected nodes with simple edges (`add_edge`) to define sequence\n",
    "- Used `START` and `END` markers for entry and exit points\n",
    "- Built workflows like: `START → validate → prepare → create → verify → END`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept**: Edges define the flow from one node to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook 105: Graph Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned to visualize and understand your workflows:\n",
    "- Generated Mermaid diagrams to see graph structure\n",
    "- Identified nodes (processing units) and edges (connections)\n",
    "- Debugged workflows by examining visual representations\n",
    "- Understood how state flows through the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept**: Visual graphs make complex workflows easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Missing? Decision-Making!\n",
    "\n",
    "All the workflows you've built so far follow a **fixed path** - the same sequence of nodes executes every time. But what if you need to:\n",
    "- Route to different validation logic based on address type?\n",
    "- Skip approval for dev folders but require it for production?\n",
    "- Handle HA firewalls differently than standalone firewalls?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where **conditional routing** comes in. It adds the final piece: **intelligent decision-making** based on state conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's learn how to make our graphs smart!"

    "## 3. Network ACL Analogy - Understanding Conditional Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ACL/Firewall Rule Processing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've worked with network firewalls or ACLs, you already understand conditional routing! Let's draw a direct parallel:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional Firewall Rule Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "When a packet arrives at a Palo Alto Networks firewall, it goes through a decision tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Packet arrives\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    v\n",
    "Check Rule 1: source=10.0.0.0/8, dest=any, app=web-browsing\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    +--- MATCH? → Action: ALLOW → Log and forward packet\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    +--- NO MATCH? → Continue to Rule 2\n",
    "            |\n",
    "            v\n",
    "Check Rule 2: source=192.168.0.0/16, dest=any, app=ssh\n",
    "            |\n",
    "            +--- MATCH? → Action: DENY → Drop packet\n",
    "            |\n",
    "            +--- NO MATCH? → Continue to Rule 3\n",
    "                    |\n",
    "                    v\n",
    "                Default: DENY → Drop packet\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The LangGraph Equivalent\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional routing in LangGraph works exactly the same way, but instead of matching packet attributes, you're matching **state attributes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "State arrives at router node\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    v\n",
    "Check condition: state[\"folder\"] == \"Production\"?\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    +--- TRUE? → Route to: approval_workflow node\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    +--- FALSE? → Check next condition\n",
    "            |\n",
    "            v\n",
    "Check condition: state[\"folder\"] == \"Development\"?\n",
    "            |\n",
    "            +--- TRUE? → Route to: direct_creation node\n",
    "            |\n",
    "            +--- FALSE? → Route to: error_handler node\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parallels\n",
    "\n",
    "| Network ACL Concept | LangGraph Concept | Example |\n",
    "|---------------------|-------------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Packet** | **State** | Data flowing through the system |\n",
    "| **ACL Rule** | **Router Function** | Decision logic examining attributes |\n",
    "| **Match Condition** | **if/elif/else** | Checking state fields |\n",
    "| **Action (ALLOW/DENY)** | **Edge Name** | Which path to route to |\n",
    "| **Next Hop** | **Next Node** | Where to send the data next |\n",
    "| **Rule Processing** | **Conditional Edge** | The decision-making mechanism |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example: SCM Address Type Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as an ACL matches on packet attributes (source IP, dest port, protocol), your LangGraph router can match on state attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Firewall ACL Logic:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "IF source_ip in 10.0.0.0/8 THEN permit\n",
    "ELSE IF source_ip in 192.168.0.0/16 THEN deny\n",
    "ELSE default_deny\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph Router Logic:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def route_by_address_type(state):\n",
    "    if state[\"address_type\"] == \"ip_netmask\":\n",
    "        return \"validate_cidr\"\n",
    "    elif state[\"address_type\"] == \"fqdn\":\n",
    "        return \"validate_dns\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"validate_range\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Routing Tables Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about conditional routing is like a **routing table**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Destination Network    | Next Hop      | Interface\n",
    "----------------------|---------------|----------\n",
    "10.0.0.0/8           | 192.168.1.1   | eth0\n",
    "172.16.0.0/12        | 192.168.1.2   | eth1\n",
    "0.0.0.0/0            | 192.168.1.254 | eth0 (default)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangGraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "State Condition              | Next Node          | Edge Name\n",
    "---------------------------|--------------------|--------------\n",
    "requires_approval == True   | approval_workflow  | \"approval_path\"\n",
    "requires_approval == False  | direct_creation    | \"direct_path\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Analogy Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "As network administrators, you're already experts at conditional logic:\n",
    "- **ACLs** = Match conditions and take actions\n",
    "- **Routing tables** = Destination-based forwarding decisions\n",
    "- **Security policies** = Rule-based processing with first-match wins\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph conditional routing uses the exact same mental model** - you're just routing state through your workflow instead of routing packets through your network!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see this in action with code."

    "1. **Router Function**: Examines state and returns an edge name\n",
    "2. **Lambda Passthrough Node**: Router node that doesn't modify state\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the most important part! The **router function** is where the decision-making happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Characteristics of Router Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Examines State**: Looks at state fields to make decisions\n",
    "2. **Returns Edge Name**: Returns a string (not a dict!)\n",
    "3. **Uses Literal Type**: Type hint specifies valid edge names\n",
    "4. **No State Updates**: Doesn't modify state, only decides routing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Literal Type Pattern - WHY IT MATTERS!\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Literal` type provides **type safety** for your routing decisions. Let's see why this is critical:\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ WITHOUT Literal - No Type Safety:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decide_path(state: MyState) -> str:\n",

    "    return \"direct_path\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ WITH Literal - Type Safety Enabled:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decide_path(state: MyState) -> Literal[\"approval_path\", \"direct_path\"]:\n",
    "    if state[\"condition\"]:\n",
    "        return \"approvel_path\"  # IDE ERROR: Not in Literal options!\n",
    "    return \"direct_path\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Literal:**\n",
    "- 🔍 **IDE Autocomplete**: Your IDE suggests valid edge names\n",
    "- 🚨 **Typo Detection**: Catches spelling mistakes at development time\n",
    "- 📚 **Documentation**: Clearly shows valid routing paths\n",
    "- 🛡️ **Type Safety**: Prevents runtime errors from invalid edge names\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `Literal` like an **ACL entry validation** - it ensures you only use valid actions (permit/deny), just like Literal ensures you only return valid edge names!\n",

    "## 6. The Lambda Passthrough Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive deep into one of the most important patterns in LangGraph: **the lambda passthrough pattern**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph has a fundamental requirement: **all nodes must return state updates** (as dictionaries). But router functions need to return **edge names** (as strings) to indicate routing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a conflict:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Regular nodes return dicts\n",
    "def regular_node(state: MyState) -> dict:\n",
    "    return {\"field\": \"updated value\"}  # ✅ Returns dict\n",
    "\n",
    "# Router functions return strings\n",
    "def router_function(state: MyState) -> str:\n",
    "    if state[\"condition\"]:\n",
    "        return \"edge_a\"  # ❌ Returns string, not dict!\n",
    "    return \"edge_b\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Lambda Passthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern `lambda state: state` solves this elegantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ WRONG - Router function doesn't return dict\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"router\", router_function)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ CORRECT - Lambda returns state unchanged\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"router\", lambda state: state)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda passthrough separates two responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node responsibility** (lambda state: state):\n",
    "   - Satisfies LangGraph's requirement that nodes return state\n",
    "   - Doesn't modify state - just passes it through unchanged\n",
    "   - Think: \"I'm a node that does nothing to state\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Router responsibility** (path= parameter):\n",
    "   - Makes the actual routing decision\n",
    "   - Examines state and returns edge name\n",
    "   - Think: \"I decide which path to take\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Add the router node\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"router\", lambda state: state)  # ← Node: pass state through\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add conditional edge\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "    source=\"router\",              # ← From the router node\n",
    "    path=decide_creation_path,    # ← Router function: makes decision\n",
    "    path_map={...}                # ← Maps edge names to nodes\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this like a router with a **control plane** and **data plane**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lambda (data plane)**: Forwards packets (state) without modification\n",
    "- **Router function (control plane)**: Makes forwarding decisions (routing logic)\n",
    "- **path_map (routing table)**: Maps destinations to next hops\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "**Always use `lambda state: state` when adding router nodes!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard pattern for all conditional routing in LangGraph. The lambda handles state (pass through), while the router function (in `path=`) handles routing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The complete pattern\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"router\", lambda state: state)  # Passthrough\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "    source=\"router\",\n",
    "    path=your_router_function,  # Decision logic\n",

    "### The Scenario\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Now it's your turn! Apply what you've learned to build a comprehensive conditional routing workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge: Multi-Path Configuration Router\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a graph that demonstrates the key routing patterns you've learned in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A: Configuration Change Type Router (3-way routing)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a router that handles different SCM configuration types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define State** with these fields:\n",
    "   - `change_type`: str (\"security_policy\", \"nat_rule\", or \"address_object\")\n",
    "   - `change_description`: str\n",
    "   - `folder`: str\n",
    "   - `processed`: bool\n",
    "   - `handler_used`: str\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Router Function** that:\n",
    "   - Returns `Literal[\"policy_path\", \"nat_path\", \"address_path\"]`\n",
    "   - Routes based on `change_type` field\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Three Handler Nodes**:\n",
    "   - `handle_security_policy`: Sets handler_used to \"security policy handler\"\n",
    "   - `handle_nat_rule`: Sets handler_used to \"NAT rule handler\"\n",
    "   - `handle_address_object`: Sets handler_used to \"address object handler\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build Graph** with:\n",
    "   - Router node using lambda passthrough\n",
    "   - Conditional edges with 3-way routing\n",
    "   - All handlers connecting to END\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test** all three paths with different change_type values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input\n",
    "{\"change_type\": \"security_policy\", \"change_description\": \"Allow web traffic\", ...}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output\n",
    "{..., \"handler_used\": \"security policy handler\", \"processed\": True}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part B (Bonus): Add Validation and Error Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want an extra challenge, extend your solution to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validation Router**: Before processing, validate the configuration\n",
    "   - Valid configurations → route to appropriate handler\n",
    "   - Invalid configurations → route to error handler\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**: Add error detection after processing\n",
    "   - Success (simulated) → route to completion\n",
    "   - Failure (simulated) → route to retry or error logging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points**:\n",
    "- Use `lambda state: state` for router nodes\n",
    "- Router functions return edge name (string)\n",
    "- Use `add_conditional_edges()` with path_map\n",
    "- Use Literal return types for type safety\n",
    "- Test all routing paths!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "- Start with Part A to practice the basic pattern\n",
    "- For Part B, you'll need multiple routers in sequence\n",
    "- Think about the flow: validate → route by type → handle → check result → route to success/error\n",

    "## 9. What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've mastered conditional routing in LangGraph. You can now build workflows that make intelligent decisions based on state conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned to:\n",
    "- ✅ Use `add_conditional_edges()` to create branching workflows\n",
    "- ✅ Write router functions with `Literal` return types\n",
    "- ✅ Apply the lambda passthrough pattern (`lambda state: state`)\n",
    "- ✅ Route based on state conditions (folder type, address type)\n",
    "- ✅ Think about routing like network ACLs and routing tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coming in Notebook 107: Looping Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "You've learned to build:\n",
    "- Linear workflows (Notebook 104): A → B → C\n",
    "- Branching workflows (Notebook 106): A → (B or C) → D\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about workflows that need to **repeat** steps? That's where **looping** comes in!\n",
    "\n",
    "In Notebook 107, you'll learn:\n",
    "- How to create loops in LangGraph (going back to previous nodes)\n",
    "- Conditional routing that can loop back (retry logic)\n",
    "- Building workflows with termination conditions\n",
    "- Real-world patterns like:\n",
    "  - **Retry loops**: Try up to 3 times, then fail\n",
    "  - **Polling loops**: Check HA sync status until synced\n",
    "  - **Batch processing**: Process list of objects one at a time\n",
    "  - **Approval loops**: Keep requesting approval until approved/rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preview: Looping Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a taste of what you'll build:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def should_retry(state) -> Literal[\"retry\", \"success\", \"failed\"]:\n",
    "    if state[\"validated\"]:\n",
    "        return \"success\"  # → END\n",
    "    elif state[\"retry_count\"] < 3:\n",
    "        return \"retry\"    # → Loop back to validate\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"failed\"   # → error_handler\n",
    "\n",
    "# This creates a loop!\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "    source=\"check_result\",\n",
    "    path=should_retry,\n",
    "    path_map={\n",
    "        \"retry\": \"validate\",      # ← Loops back!\n",
    "        \"success\": END,\n",
    "        \"failed\": \"error_handler\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 10. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conditional Routing**\n",
    "   - Enables workflows to make decisions based on state\n",
    "   - Creates branching paths instead of linear sequences\n",
    "   - Like ACL rules or routing table lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Three Components**\n",
    "   - **Router Function**: Examines state, returns edge name\n",
    "   - **Lambda Passthrough**: `lambda state: state` for router node\n",
    "   - **Conditional Edge**: `add_conditional_edges()` connects them\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Router Functions**\n",
    "   - Return string (edge name), not dict (state update)\n",
    "   - Use `Literal` type hints for type safety\n",
    "   - Contain decision logic (if/elif/else)\n",
    "   - Don't modify state, only decide routing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lambda Passthrough Pattern**\n",
    "   - `graph.add_node(\"router\", lambda state: state)`\n",
    "   - Satisfies LangGraph requirement (nodes return state)\n",
    "   - Allows router function to make decisions separately\n",
    "   - Standard pattern for all conditional routing\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **add_conditional_edges() API**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "       source=\"router\",        # Node making decision\n",
    "       path=router_function,   # Function with logic\n",
    "       path_map={              # Edge name → destination\n",
    "           \"edge_a\": \"node_a\",\n",
    "           \"edge_b\": \"node_b\"\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Network ACL Analogy**\n",
    "   - State = Packet flowing through network\n",
    "   - Router function = ACL rule matching logic\n",
    "   - Edge name = Action (permit → node_a, deny → node_b)\n",
    "   - path_map = Routing table (destination → next hop)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now build:\n",
    "- Environment-based routing (dev vs staging vs prod)\n",
    "- Type-based validation (IP vs FQDN vs Range)\n",
    "- Success/failure paths (error handling)\n",
    "- Approval workflows (requires approval vs direct)\n",
    "- HA vs standalone logic (different upgrade paths)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notebook 107**: Looping workflows and retry logic\n",
    "- **Future Notebooks**: LLM-powered routers that make AI-based decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Define router function with Literal return type\n",
    "def router(state: MyState) -> Literal[\"path_a\", \"path_b\"]:\n",
    "    if state[\"condition\"]:\n",
    "        return \"path_a\"\n",
    "    return \"path_b\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Add router node with lambda passthrough\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"router\", lambda state: state)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Add conditional edges with path_map\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "    source=\"router\",\n",
    "    path=router,\n",
    "    path_map={\"path_a\": \"node_a\", \"path_b\": \"node_b\"}\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You're now ready to build sophisticated, decision-making workflows! 🎉"
