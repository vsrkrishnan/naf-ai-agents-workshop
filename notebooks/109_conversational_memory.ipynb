    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "We're fixing the memory problem from notebook 108! This time, our bot will:\n",

    "- Maintain context across multiple turns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "You: My firewall is fw-prod-01\n",
    "AI: Got it! How can I help with fw-prod-01?\n",
    "\n",

    "AI: Your firewall's hostname is fw-prod-01.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Structure:** (Same as before, but with memory!)\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back! In notebook 108, we built a simple AI bot that had one critical flaw: **it couldn't remember anything**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem We're Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember this from last time?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You: My firewall hostname is fw-prod-01\n",
    "AI: Thanks for letting me know!\n",
    "\n",
    "You: What is my firewall hostname?\n",
    "AI: I don't have information about your firewall hostname.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** Each query was independent - we never stored the conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Conversation Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement **manual conversation memory** by:\n",
    "1. Storing both `HumanMessage` and `AIMessage` objects\n",
    "2. Maintaining a conversation history list\n",
    "3. Sending the entire conversation to the LLM each time\n",
    "4. Updating the history with each exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Manual First?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we learn the advanced `Annotated[list, add_messages]` reducer pattern (coming in notebook 110), we'll build memory manually. This helps you understand:\n",
    "- How conversation history actually works\n",
    "- Why reducers are so helpful (you'll appreciate them more!)\n",
    "- The cost implications of growing histories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "With memory, our PAN-OS bot can handle:\n",
    "- Multi-turn troubleshooting: \"My firewall is dropping traffic\" → \"Check logs\" → \"What should I look for?\"\n",
    "- Context-aware recommendations: \"I'm on 10.1\" → \"Should I upgrade?\" → \"What's the path to 11.0?\"\n",
    "- Configuration assistance: \"I need NAT\" → \"For what source?\" → \"How do I configure it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build it!"

    "## 2. Setup and New Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's New?\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to notebook 108, we're adding:\n",
    "1. **AIMessage**: To represent messages from the AI\n",
    "2. **Union**: Type annotation for handling multiple message types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Union Refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember from notebook 101? `Union` lets a variable accept multiple types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage]  # Can be EITHER type\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perfect for conversation history where we have both human and AI messages!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note About AI Agentic Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important insight:** You could build AI agents with pure Python functions - you don't technically need LangChain or LangGraph!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I recommend using these libraries because:\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: Great balance of control vs. convenience\n",
    "- **Reduces boilerplate**: Handles a lot of tedious code for you\n",
    "- **Battle-tested**: Robust implementations of common patterns\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: More control than alternatives like CrewAI or Autogen\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of LangGraph as the sweet spot between \"total control\" (pure Python) and \"total convenience\" (high-level frameworks)."

    "\n",
    "| Type | Purpose | Example |\n",
    "|------|---------|----------|\n",
    "| `HumanMessage` | User to AI | \"What's the upgrade path?\" |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why AIMessage?\n",
    "\n",

    "- What the user asked (HumanMessage)\n",
    "- What the AI responded (AIMessage)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Union for Multiple Types\n",
    "\n",
    "We could create two separate lists:\n",

    "    human_messages: List[HumanMessage]\n",
    "    ai_messages: List[AIMessage]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is messy! How do we know which AI message responds to which human message?\n",

    "**Better approach** - single list with Union:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Better - single list with both types\n",
    "class GoodState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: List[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage]]\n",

    "## 6. Implementing the Conversation Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge: Synchronizing History\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a problem to solve: **how do we maintain conversation history across multiple invocations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The issue:**\n",
    "- Each time we call `agent.invoke()`, we pass initial state\n",
    "- But we need to PERSIST the conversation between calls\n",
    "- The graph doesn't automatically remember between invocations (yet!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution:** Maintain an external `conversation_history` variable and synchronize it after each turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# External history variable\n",
    "conversation_history = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# Turn 1\n",
    "conversation_history.append(HumanMessage(content=\"Turn 1 query\"))\n",
    "result = agent.invoke({\"messages\": conversation_history})\n",
    "conversation_history = result[\"messages\"]  # ⭐ Sync!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Turn 2\n",
    "conversation_history.append(HumanMessage(content=\"Turn 2 query\"))\n",
    "result = agent.invoke({\"messages\": conversation_history})\n",
    "conversation_history = result[\"messages\"]  # ⭐ Sync again!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Before invoke**: We add the new human message to our history\n",
    "2. **During invoke**: The agent processes ALL messages and appends AI response\n",
    "3. **After invoke**: We update our history with the full conversation (including AI response)\n",
    "4. **Next turn**: We start with the complete history\n",
    "\n",
    "This manual synchronization ensures context is preserved across invocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement it!"

    "Before we test our implementation, let's be explicit about the **pain points** of this manual approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Verbose and Repetitive**\n",

    "# Forget ONE sync and you lose context:\n",
    "conversation_history.append(HumanMessage(content=\"Question\"))\n",
    "result = agent.invoke({\"messages\": conversation_history})\n",
    "# ❌ OOPS! Forgot to sync - next turn won't have AI response!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Manual State Synchronization**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# You're responsible for keeping external state in sync:\n",
    "state[\"messages\"].append(AIMessage(...))  # Inside node\n",
    "conversation_history = result[\"messages\"]  # Outside node\n",
    "# Must happen EVERY time, no exceptions!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. No Automatic Merging**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# With reducers (notebook 110), this happens automatically:\n",
    "# state[\"messages\"].append(msg)  # ✅ Automatic merge!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Without reducers (this notebook), you must:\n",
    "# - Manually append human messages\n",
    "# - Manually sync after invoke\n",
    "# - Manually handle state updates\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Boilerplate Everywhere**\n",
    "Every conversation function needs the same pattern:\n",
    "- Add human message\n",
    "- Invoke agent\n",
    "- Sync history\n",
    "- Extract response\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Token Cost Awareness Required**\n",
    "You must manually implement trimming, summarization, or windowing to control costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Learn This Manual Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "If it's so painful, why teach it? **Because understanding manual management:**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Shows you HOW conversation memory works under the hood  \n",
    "✅ Helps you debug when automatic solutions fail  \n",

    "✅ Gives you full control when you need custom behavior  \n",

    "\n",
    "### The Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "Our conversation memory works... **but only while the notebook is running!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens when:**\n",
    "- The notebook kernel restarts?\n",
    "- The user closes their session?\n",
    "- The application crashes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** All conversation history is LOST because it's stored in a Python variable in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, you need to persist conversations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Support Bot**: User comes back tomorrow and expects the bot to remember previous issues\n",
    "2. **Network Operations Assistant**: Shift handoffs require preserving troubleshooting context\n",
    "3. **Configuration Wizard**: Multi-session workflows need to resume where they left off\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: JSON File Storage**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save conversation\n",
    "with open('conversation.json', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    json.dump([msg.dict() for msg in conversation_history], f)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load conversation\n",
    "with open('conversation.json', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    data = json.load(f)\n",
    "    conversation_history = [HumanMessage(**m) if m['type']=='human' \n",
    "                           else AIMessage(**m) for m in data]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Database Storage (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Pseudocode\n",
    "db.conversations.insert({\n",
    "    'session_id': 'user-123',\n",
    "    'messages': conversation_history,\n",
    "    'timestamp': datetime.now()\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 3: LangGraph Checkpointing** ⭐ (Coming in notebook 110!)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\n",
    "\n",
    "checkpointer = MemorySaver()\n",
    "agent = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)\n",
    "# Automatically persists state!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Haven't Implemented This Yet\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we're focusing on **understanding manual memory management**. Persistence adds complexity, and we want you to grasp the fundamentals first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next notebook (110):** We'll introduce **reducers and tools** which handle memory management automatically!\n",

    "\n",
    "### Cost Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume each message averages 50 tokens:\n",

    "| Turn | Messages Sent | Total Tokens | Cost Multiplier |\n",
    "|------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|\n",

    "**After 50 turns**: You're paying 99x more per query than turn 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example pricing (GPT-4):**\n",
    "- Input: $0.03 / 1K tokens\n",
    "- Turn 1: $0.0015\n",
    "- Turn 50: $0.15 (100x more!)\n",
    "- 1000 users × 50 turns = **$150,000** 😱\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Turn 1: Send 1 message\n",
    "llm.invoke([HumanMessage(\"Hello\")])  # 1 message\n",
    "\n",
    "# Turn 2: Send 3 messages (H, A, H)\n",
    "llm.invoke([HumanMessage(\"Hello\"), \n",
    "           AIMessage(\"Hi!\"), \n",
    "           HumanMessage(\"How are you?\")])  # 3 messages\n",
    "\n",
    "# Turn 3: Send 5 messages (H, A, H, A, H)\n",
    "llm.invoke([...all previous messages...])  # 5 messages\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each turn re-sends ALL previous messages!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Message Window Trimming** (Keep last N messages)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MAX_HISTORY = 10\n",
    "recent_messages = conversation_history[-MAX_HISTORY:]\n",
    "result = agent.invoke({\"messages\": recent_messages})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Summarization** (Compress old messages)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Every 20 messages, summarize the conversation\n",
    "if len(conversation_history) > 20:\n",
    "    summary = summarize_conversation(conversation_history[:20])\n",
    "    conversation_history = [HumanMessage(content=f\"Summary: {summary}\")] + conversation_history[20:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Smart Truncation** (Keep system messages + recent)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "system_messages = [msg for msg in conversation_history if isinstance(msg, SystemMessage)]\n",
    "recent_messages = conversation_history[-10:]\n",
    "trimmed = system_messages + recent_messages\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Token-Based Trimming** (Stay under budget)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tiktoken\n",
    "\n",
    "def trim_to_token_limit(messages, max_tokens=4000):\n",
    "    encoder = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(\"gpt-4\")\n",
    "    # Count tokens and trim from the start\n",
    "    # (implementation left as exercise)\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy | Pros | Cons |\n",
    "|----------|------|------|\n",
    "| Window Trimming | Simple, predictable | Loses old context |\n",
    "| Summarization | Preserves key info | Adds LLM calls |\n",

    "## 10. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've built a conversational AI agent with memory. Let's recap what you've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AIMessage and Union Types** - Tracking both sides of the conversation\n",
    "   - `Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage]` allows mixed message types\n",
    "   - Modern Python 3.10+ syntax: `list[HumanMessage | AIMessage]`\n",
    "   - Single list preserves conversation order\n",
    "   - Essential for conversation memory\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory-Enabled State** - Extending state to support conversation\n",
    "   - Changed from `List[HumanMessage]` to `List[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage]]`\n",
    "   - Single type change enables full conversation tracking\n",
    "   - State can now hold complete dialogue history\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversation Node with Memory** - Implementing the memory mechanism\n",
    "   - `state[\"messages\"].append(AIMessage(...))` saves AI responses\n",
    "   - Each invoke builds on previous context\n",
    "   - LLM sees full conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Manual History Management** - Synchronizing state across invocations\n",
    "   - External `conversation_history` variable\n",
    "   - `conversation_history = result[\"messages\"]` synchronizes state\n",
    "   - Pattern: add human message → invoke → sync history\n",
    "   - **Critical:** Forgetting sync breaks memory!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real-World SCM Wizards** - Practical multi-turn workflows\n",
    "   - NAT policy configuration across 4 turns\n",
    "   - Address object creation with incremental data collection\n",
    "   - Demonstrates value of memory for complex operations\n",
    "   - Shows how context builds across interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Challenges of Manual Management** - Understanding the pain points\n",
    "   - Verbose and repetitive synchronization code\n",
    "   - Error-prone (forget sync = lose context)\n",
    "   - Manual state management is tedious\n",
    "   - No automatic message merging\n",
    "   - Boilerplate in every conversation function\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Conversation Persistence** - Saving conversations beyond runtime\n",
    "   - JSON file storage for simple persistence\n",
    "   - Database options for production\n",
    "   - Checkpointing as the ultimate solution (next notebook!)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Token Cost Management** - Controlling growing costs\n",
    "   - Costs grow linearly with conversation length\n",
    "   - Window trimming keeps recent context\n",
    "   - Trade-off: cost savings vs. context loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Manual Memory Management Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this manual approach is crucial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fundamentals**: You now understand HOW conversation memory actually works\n",
    "- **Debugging**: When things go wrong, you can trace the message flow\n",
    "- **Appreciation**: You'll appreciate automated solutions (reducers, checkpointing) more\n",
    "- **Control**: You know when to use manual vs. automatic approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problems We Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ❌ **Manual synchronization is tedious**: `conversation_history = result[\"messages\"]` every time\n",
    "2. ❌ **Error-prone**: Forget ONE sync and lose context completely\n",
    "3. ❌ **No automatic persistence**: Need custom code to save conversations\n",
    "4. ❌ **Token costs grow unbounded**: Need manual trimming logic\n",
    "5. ❌ **Boilerplate everywhere**: Lots of repetitive code\n",
    "6. ❌ **State management burden**: Developer responsible for all synchronization\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next: The Better Way with Reducers and Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "In **notebook 110**, we'll solve ALL of these problems with LangGraph's powerful features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Automatic Message Merging with Reducers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual approach (this notebook):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: List[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage]]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Must manually sync every time:\n",
    "conversation_history.append(HumanMessage(content=msg))\n",
    "result = agent.invoke({\"messages\": conversation_history})\n",
    "conversation_history = result[\"messages\"]  # Don't forget!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic approach (notebook 110):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n",
    "from typing import Annotated\n",
    "\n",
    "class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]  # ⭐ Auto-merge!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Just invoke - merging happens automatically:\n",
    "result = agent.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=msg)]})\n",
    "# No manual sync needed! The reducer handles everything!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tool Calling - Agents That Take Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Our current bot can only TALK about configurations - it can't actually DO anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution (notebook 110):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.tools import tool\n",
    "\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def get_firewall_version(hostname: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Get the PAN-OS version for a firewall.\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Could call SCM API here!\n",
    "    return \"10.1.0\"\n",
    "\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def create_address_object(name: str, ip: str, folder: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Create an address object in SCM.\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Could use pan-scm-sdk here!\n",
    "    return f\"Created {name} with IP {ip}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Agent can now:\n",
    "# - Decide which tool to use\n",
    "# - Call tools with correct parameters\n",
    "# - Reason about tool results\n",
    "# - Take actual configuration actions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ReAct Pattern - Reasoning and Acting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook 109:** Linear execution (START → process → END)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook 110:** Intelligent loops:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. REASON: \"User wants firewall version, I should use get_firewall_version tool\"\n",
    "2. ACT: Call get_firewall_version(\"fw-prod-01\")\n",
    "3. OBSERVE: \"Version is 10.1.0\"\n",
    "4. REASON: \"Now I can answer the user's question\"\n",
    "5. RESPOND: \"Your firewall fw-prod-01 is running PAN-OS 10.1.0\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What You'll Build Next\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebook 110, you'll create a PAN-OS agent that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Remember conversations** (with automatic reducers)  \n",
    "✅ **Call real tools** (check versions, create objects, modify configs)  \n",
    "✅ **Reason about actions** (ReAct pattern)  \n",
    "✅ **Handle multi-step tasks** (plan → act → observe → respond)  \n",
    "✅ **No manual sync required** (reducers handle everything)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Notebook 109 (Manual) | Notebook 110 (Automatic) |\n",
    "|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| **Memory** | Manual sync required | Automatic with reducers |\n",
    "| **State Merging** | `history = result[\"messages\"]` | `Annotated[list, add_messages]` |\n",
    "| **Actions** | Can only talk | Can use tools |\n",
    "| **Pattern** | Linear (START→END) | ReAct (Reason→Act→Observe) |\n",
    "| **Code** | Lots of boilerplate | Clean and concise |\n",
    "| **Error Risk** | High (forget sync) | Low (automatic) |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Conversation memory requires tracking BOTH human and AI messages  \n",
    "✅ Manual memory means appending AI responses to state  \n",
    "✅ History synchronization is critical across invocations  \n",
    "✅ Forgetting to sync breaks memory completely  \n",
    "✅ Real-world wizards (NAT, address objects) show practical value  \n",
    "✅ Persistence and cost management are real production concerns  \n",
    "✅ LangGraph provides better solutions (reducers + tools)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "**Want more practice?** Try these exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement summarization trimming**: Instead of window trimming, use an LLM to summarize old messages\n",
    "2. **Add conversation export**: Create a function to export conversations to markdown format\n",
    "3. **Build a security policy wizard**: Multi-turn wizard for creating security rules\n",
    "4. **Implement conversation branching**: Save/load different conversation threads\n",
    "5. **Add conversation analytics**: Track average message length, turn count, common topics\n",
    "6. **Create conversation search**: Find past conversations by keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ready for Notebook 110?\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a **deep understanding** of how conversation memory works at the fundamental level. This knowledge will make notebook 110's automatic features much more meaningful - you'll understand what they're doing under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In notebook 110**, you'll learn:\n",
    "- ✨ The `add_messages` reducer for automatic message merging\n",
    "- ✨ Creating and using tools with `@tool` decorator\n",
    "- ✨ The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent pattern\n",
    "- ✨ Building agents that can take real actions with SCM\n",
    "- ✨ No more manual synchronization - ever!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** You don't need to memorize all of this! The important thing is understanding that:\n",
    "- Conversation memory requires tracking message history\n",
    "- This can be done manually (tedious but instructive)\n",
    "- LangGraph's reducers automate the tedious parts\n",
    "- Understanding manual approach helps you debug and customize\n",
    "\n",
    "Great work! You're now ready for ReAct agents with automatic memory and tools! 🚀\n",
