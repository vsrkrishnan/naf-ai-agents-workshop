    "\n",
    "Before we dive into sequential multi-node workflows, let's recap what you've mastered in the previous notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Notebook 103: Your First Graph - Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned the fundamentals of LangGraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Schemas** - How to define state structure using TypedDict to track workflow data\n",
    "- **Node Functions** - Creating Python functions that process state and return updates\n",
    "- **Basic Graphs** - Building simple `START → node → END` workflows\n",
    "- **Graph Compilation** - Using `compile()` to create executable applications\n",
    "- **Invocation** - Running graphs with `invoke()` and passing initial state\n",
    "- **Visualization** - Using mermaid diagrams to see graph structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Pattern from 103**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define state\n",
    "class MyState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    field: str\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create node\n",
    "def process(state: MyState) -> dict:\n",

    "- **Optional Fields** - Handling fields that may or may not be initialized\n",

    "- **Notebook 105** - Building a complete policy with multiple dependent rules (multi-step workflow)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as firewall policies have rules that must be evaluated in order, LangGraph workflows have nodes that execute sequentially!\n",

    "## 2. Sequential Multi-Node Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're getting to the real power of LangGraph - **connecting multiple nodes** to create sequential workflows!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We're Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, you've built graphs with a single node:\n",
    "```\n",
    "START → node → END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you need **multiple processing steps** that run in a specific order? Like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "START → validate → create → verify → END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a **sequential workflow** - nodes execute one after another, each building on the work of the previous node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We're Building\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll build a simple two-node SCM address object workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node 1 (Validate)**: Check if address object name is valid\n",
    "2. **Node 2 (Create)**: Create the address object in SCM\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll expand to a complete three-node Tag → Address → Group workflow!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Admin Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this like a **configuration pipeline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Validate syntax and format\n",
    "- **Step 2**: Stage configuration changes\n",
    "- **Step 3**: Commit to running config\n",
    "- **Step 4**: Verify changes applied\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step **must complete** before the next one runs. That's exactly what sequential workflows do!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build one!\n"

    "\n",
    "Time to practice building sequential workflows! This exercise builds on what you just learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge**: Create a three-node SCM address object creation workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Create a state called `AddressWorkflowState` with FIVE fields:\n",
    "  - `address_name` (str): Address object name\n",
    "  - `ip_netmask` (str): IP address with netmask\n",
    "  - `folder` (str): Target SCM folder\n",
    "  - `created_by` (str): Administrator creating the object\n",
    "  - `workflow_summary` (str): Cumulative summary built by each node\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build THREE nodes in sequence:\n",
    "  1. **Node 1** (`validate_input`): Validates the address input and starts the summary\n",
    "     - Output: `\"Address '{address_name}' validated. \"`\n",
    "  2. **Node 2** (`check_folder`): Validates the folder exists and appends to summary\n",
    "     - Output: Append `\"Folder '{folder}' verified. \"`\n",
    "  3. **Node 3** (`create_object`): Simulates SCM API creation and finalizes summary\n",
    "     - Output: Append `\"Created by {created_by} in SCM successfully.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Input/Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input:\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"address_name\": \"web_server\",\n",
    "    \"ip_netmask\": \"192.168.1.10/32\",\n",
    "    \"folder\": \"Texas\",\n",
    "    \"created_by\": \"admin@example.com\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final Output workflow_summary:\n",
    "\"Address 'web_server' validated. Folder 'Texas' verified. Created by admin@example.com in SCM successfully.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "- You'll need to use `add_edge()` TWICE (to connect 3 nodes in sequence)\n",
    "- Each node must READ the existing summary and APPEND to it (except Node 1 which creates it)\n",
    "- Remember docstrings for each node function!\n",
    "- Pattern: `graph.add_edge(\"node1\", \"node2\")` then `graph.add_edge(\"node2\", \"node3\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. Define `AddressWorkflowState` with 5 fields\n",
    "2. Create `validate_input` node (starts summary)\n",
    "3. Create `check_folder` node (appends to summary)\n",
    "4. Create `create_object` node (appends to summary)\n",
    "5. Build graph, add all 3 nodes\n",
    "6. Set entry point to first node\n",
    "7. Add edge from node1 to node2\n",
    "8. Add edge from node2 to node3\n",
    "9. Set finish point to last node\n",
    "10. Compile\n",
    "11. Visualize with IPython\n",
    "12. Test with sample input\n",

    "### 4.8 Key Insights: Production-Ready SCM Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Makes This Production-Ready:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Proper Node Separation**\n",
    "   - Each node handles ONE API call\n",
    "   - Clean separation of concerns\n",
    "   - Easy to test and debug\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ✅ **Dependency Validation**\n",
    "   - Nodes check prerequisites before executing\n",
    "   - Prevents invalid configurations\n",
    "   - Clear error messages\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ✅ **State Accumulation**\n",
    "   - Workflow log builds up across all nodes\n",
    "   - Complete audit trail\n",
    "   - Debugging visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ✅ **Realistic API Simulation**\n",
    "   - Mirrors actual `pan-scm-sdk` patterns\n",
    "   - Uses correct config structures\n",
    "   - Returns simulated IDs like real API\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World SCM SDK Equivalents:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow simulates:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scm.client import Scm\n",
    "\n",
    "client = Scm(client_id=\"...\", client_secret=\"...\", tsg_id=\"...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Create tag\n",
    "tag = client.tag.create({\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Production\",\n",
    "    \"color\": \"Red\",\n",
    "    \"folder\": \"Texas\"\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Create address object\n",
    "address = client.address.create({\n",
    "    \"name\": \"web_server\",\n",
    "    \"ip_netmask\": \"192.168.1.10/32\",\n",
    "    \"folder\": \"Texas\",\n",
    "    \"tag\": [\"Production\"]\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Create address group\n",
    "group = client.address_group.create({\n",
    "    \"name\": \"web_servers\",\n",
    "    \"static\": [\"web_server\"],\n",
    "    \"folder\": \"Texas\",\n",
    "    \"tag\": [\"Production\"]\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependency Tracking Demonstrated:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how each node validates its dependencies:\n",
    "- **Node 2 (create_address)** checks `state[\"tag_created\"]` before proceeding\n",
    "- **Node 3 (create_group)** checks BOTH `state[\"tag_created\"]` AND `state[\"address_created\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures objects are created in the correct order and prevents invalid SCM configurations!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You now understand sequential workflows with dependency tracking! In **Notebook 106**, we'll add **conditional routing** to handle different configuration scenarios (e.g., production vs development folders)."

    "## 6. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've mastered sequential multi-node workflows in LangGraph! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Built Multi-Node Graphs**\n",
    "   - Created workflows with 2-3 nodes executing in sequence\n",
    "   - Understood how state flows through multiple processing steps\n",
    "   - Saw how each node builds on the work of previous nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chained Nodes with add_edge()**\n",
    "   - Used `add_edge()` to explicitly control execution order\n",
    "   - Connected START to first node, nodes to each other, and last node to END\n",
    "   - Learned the difference between `add_edge()` and `set_entry_point()`/`set_finish_point()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implemented Error Handling**\n",
    "   - Added try/except blocks to handle SCM API exceptions\n",
    "   - Tracked errors in state for debugging and reporting\n",
    "   - Tested both success and failure paths\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Understood State Transformation**\n",
    "   - Saw how state evolves as it passes through the pipeline\n",
    "   - Each node reads state, processes data, and returns partial updates\n",
    "   - Final state contains accumulated results from all nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Created Complete SCM Workflows**\n",
    "   - Built production-ready Tag → Address → Group workflows\n",
    "   - Applied real-world dependency patterns (tags before addresses, addresses before groups)\n",
    "   - Simulated actual `pan-scm-sdk` API usage patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Visualized Complex Graphs**\n",
    "   - Used mermaid diagrams to understand multi-node structure\n",
    "   - Saw clear visual representation of workflow execution order\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Patterns You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequential Workflow Pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define state\n",
    "class WorkflowState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    input_data: str\n",
    "    step1_result: str\n",
    "    step2_result: str\n",
    "    final_result: str\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create nodes\n",
    "def step1(state: WorkflowState) -> dict:\n",
    "    result = f\"Step 1 processed: {state['input_data']}\"\n",
    "    return {\"step1_result\": result}\n",
    "\n",
    "def step2(state: WorkflowState) -> dict:\n",
    "    # Builds on step1_result\n",
    "    result = f\"Step 2 processed: {state['step1_result']}\"\n",
    "    return {\"step2_result\": result}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build graph with add_edge()\n",
    "graph = StateGraph(WorkflowState)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"step1\", step1)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"step2\", step2)\n",
    "graph.add_edge(START, \"step1\")      # START → step1\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"step1\", \"step2\")    # step1 → step2\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"step2\", END)        # step2 → END\n",
    "app = graph.compile()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Handling Pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def create_with_error_handling(state: MyState) -> dict:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Node with robust error handling.\"\"\"\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Attempt operation\n",
    "        result = create_scm_object(state[\"name\"])\n",
    "        return {\n",
    "            \"result\": f\"Success: {result}\",\n",
    "            \"error\": None\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        return {\n",
    "            \"result\": None,\n",
    "            \"error\": f\"Failed: {str(e)}\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequential workflow patterns you learned apply to many network automation scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configuration Deployment**: Validate → Stage → Commit → Verify\n",
    "- **Security Policy Creation**: Tag → Address → Service → Rule\n",
    "- **Compliance Auditing**: Fetch Config → Parse Rules → Check Compliance → Generate Report\n",
    "- **Batch Operations**: List Objects → Validate Each → Apply Changes → Log Results\n",
    "- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup Config → Validate Backup → Test Restore → Store Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Sequential execution** - Nodes run in the order you define with `add_edge()`  \n",
    "✅ **State accumulation** - Each node adds to state, building up results  \n",

    "3. **Implement retry logic** for transient failures\n",
    "4. **Add logging** for audit trails and debugging\n",
    "5. **Validate inputs** before API calls\n",

    "\n",
    "Sequential workflows enable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✨ **Modular design** - Each node does one thing well\n",
    "- ✨ **Reusability** - Nodes can be reused in different workflows\n",
    "- ✨ **Testability** - Test each node independently\n",
    "- ✨ **Visibility** - Visualize entire workflow structure\n",
    "- ✨ **Maintainability** - Easy to modify or extend workflows\n",
    "- ✨ **Error isolation** - Failures are contained and traceable\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "START → validate → create → verify → END\n",
