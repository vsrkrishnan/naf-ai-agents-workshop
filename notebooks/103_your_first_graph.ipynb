    "Welcome to your first hands-on LangGraph coding workshop! This is where we transition from theory to practice.\n",

    "### A Quick Confession\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a confession to make: **we're not building AI agents yet**. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't actually written any LangGraph code yet, and jumping straight into combining LLMs, APIs, tools, and complex workflows would be messy and confusing. This workshop is designed to be beginner-friendly, detailed, and comprehensive - we're going to take it step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry - we'll be coding AI agents soon! Right now, we're going to:\n",
    "1. Build a simple graph\n",
    "2. Understand LangGraph syntax and patterns\n",
    "3. Get confident with how graphs work\n",
    "4. **Then** we'll build more complex workflows (in later notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Hello World\" Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're building today is what I call the **Hello World Graph** - the most basic form of graph you can build in LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives for this workshop:**\n",
    "- Understand and define agent state structure\n",
    "- Create simple node functions that process and update state\n",
    "- Build your first basic LangGraph structure\n",
    "- Learn how to compile, invoke, and process graphs\n",
    "- **Main goal**: Understand how data flows through a single node in LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We're Building\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a preview of the graph structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "START → validate_address_object → END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest possible graph:\n",
    "- A **START** point (entry)\n",
    "- A **single node** in the middle (validate)\n",
    "- An **END** point (exit)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a **basic SCM address object validation workflow**:\n",
    "- You start the validation\n",
    "- Process address object information\n",
    "- Complete the validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple, but it will teach you the fundamental mechanics of LangGraph!\n",

    "### Why Docstrings Matter (Especially for AI Agents!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings are **very important** in LangGraph. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For Human Developers**: Docstrings explain what your function does, making code maintainable\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For AI Agents** (coming in later notebooks): When you build AI agents with LLMs, they read docstrings to understand:\n",
    "   - What each tool/function does\n",
    "   - What parameters it accepts\n",
    "   - What it returns\n",
    "   - When to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: When we build an AI agent in Notebook 106, if you have:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def validate_address_object(state):\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"Validate SCM address object configuration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Checks that address object name follows conventions and is ready for creation.\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI agent reads this docstring and understands: \"This function validates address objects - I should use it when the user asks to validate a configuration before creating it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the docstring, the AI agent doesn't know what your function does or when to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Your First Node\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a docstring: use three quotation marks `\\\"\\\"\\\"`\n",

    "**Key Differences from Learning Version:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real API Client**: Initializes `ScmClient` with credentials\n",
    "2. **Exception Handling**: Uses try-catch for SCM-specific errors\n",
    "3. **Actual Validation**: Calls `client.address.fetch()` to check if name exists\n",
    "4. **Error Recovery**: Gracefully handles failures and updates state accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we don't run this now:**\n",
    "- ❌ Requires API credentials (client_id, client_secret, tsg_id)\n",
    "- ❌ Requires network connection to SCM\n",
    "- ❌ More complex for first graph lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you'll use this:**\n",
    "- ✅ Notebooks 104-107: We'll add actual SCM operations\n",
    "- ✅ Production automation: Every real workflow needs this pattern\n",
    "- ✅ Notebooks 110-111: AI agents will call these as tools\n",

    "### 📚 Modern LangGraph Pattern: add_edge()\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Note**: We used `set_entry_point()` and `set_finish_point()` above because they're simple and intuitive for beginners. However, there's another pattern you'll see in modern LangGraph code (2025+):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Alternative pattern using add_edge() - also valid!\n",
    "graph.add_edge(START, \"validate\")  # Connect START → validate\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"validate\", END)    # Connect validate → END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both patterns work perfectly!** Here's the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Best For | Why? |\n",
    "|---------|----------|------|\n",
    "| `set_entry_point()` / `set_finish_point()` | Simple, single-path graphs | Clearer intent, easier to read for beginners |\n",
    "| `add_edge()` | Complex graphs with multiple paths | More flexible, explicit edge control |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which should you use?**\n",
    "- For this notebook and simple graphs: Either pattern is fine!\n",
    "- For Notebooks 104-107 (multi-node, conditional routing): `add_edge()` becomes more important\n",
    "- For production code: `add_edge()` is the modern standard\n",
    "\n",
    "**Looking ahead**: In Notebook 106 (Conditional Routing), you'll learn conditional edges where `add_edge()` really shines:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This flexibility comes with add_edge() pattern\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "    \"validate\",\n",
    "    route_function,  # Decides which path to take\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"success\": \"create\",\n",
    "        \"error\": \"retry\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Pro Tip**: We're teaching you `set_entry_point()` now for clarity, but you'll graduate to `add_edge()` as graphs get complex. Both are valid LangGraph syntax!"

    "### Key Concepts Illustrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Flows Through**: The initial state enters at START and flows through each node\n",

    "## 5.1 Exercise: SCM Address Object Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Time for your very first exercise! This is quite similar to what we just did, but now it's your turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge**: Create an extended SCM address object validation workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "- Create a state that tracks: `address_name`, `folder`, and `validation_status`\n",
    "- Pass in an address name (like \"web_server\") and folder name (like \"Texas\")\n",
    "- Build a node that validates the address object and updates status\n",
    "- Output something like: \"Address object 'web_server' in folder 'Texas' is valid and ready for creation\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Hints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Definition** (Step 1):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class ExtendedAddressState(TypedDict):\n",
    "       \"\"\"Your docstring here\"\"\"\n",
    "       address_name: str      # Name of the address object\n",
    "       folder: str            # SCM folder name (e.g., 'Texas', 'Shared')\n",
    "       validation_status: str # Validation result message\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Node Function** (Step 2):\n",
    "   - Function signature: `def validate_address_config(state: ExtendedAddressState) -> dict:`\n",
    "   - Read both `address_name` and `folder` from state\n",
    "   - Create a status message using both values\n",
    "   - Return ONLY `{\"validation_status\": \"your message here\"}`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graph Building** (Steps 3-5):\n",
    "   - Use `StateGraph(ExtendedAddressState)`\n",
    "   - Add node with name like `\"validate_config\"`\n",
    "   - Use `set_entry_point()` and `set_finish_point()` with your node name\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing** (Steps 7-8):\n",
    "   - Invoke with: `{\"address_name\": \"web_server\", \"folder\": \"Texas\", \"validation_status\": \"\"}`\n",
    "   - Check that result includes all three fields\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria**:\n",
    "- ✅ State has exactly 3 fields (address_name, folder, validation_status)\n",
    "- ✅ Node function has proper docstring\n",
    "- ✅ Node returns only validation_status (partial update)\n",
    "- ✅ Graph compiles without errors\n",
    "- ✅ Visualization shows START → your_node → END\n",
    "- ✅ Invoke returns all fields with validation_status populated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:\n",
    "- ❌ Don't return the entire state - return only the field you're updating\n",
    "- ❌ Don't forget the docstring - it's important for future AI agent integration\n",
    "- ❌ Node name in add_node() must match set_entry_point() and set_finish_point()\n",
    "- ❌ Don't forget to compile before invoking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to complete**:\n",
    "1. Define ExtendedAddressState class with three fields\n",
    "2. Create validate_address_config node function\n",
    "3. Build graph with StateGraph\n",
    "4. Add the node with add_node()\n",
    "5. Connect START and END with set_entry_point() and set_finish_point()\n",
    "6. Compile the graph\n",
    "7. Visualize with draw_mermaid_png()\n",

    "## 5.2 Troubleshooting Common Beginner Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "As you build your first graphs, you might encounter some common issues. Here are solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error 1: KeyError when accessing state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "KeyError: 'name'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Trying to access a state field that doesn't exist or wasn't passed in invoke()\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ BAD - state field doesn't exist\n",
    "def my_node(state: AddressObjectState) -> dict:\n",
    "    return {\"unknown_field\": \"value\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ GOOD - use only fields defined in TypedDict\n",
    "def my_node(state: AddressObjectState) -> dict:\n",
    "    return {\"status\": \"value\"}  # 'status' is in AddressObjectState\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error 2: Node function returns wrong type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Node function returns None instead of dict\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ BAD - forgot to return\n",
    "def my_node(state: AddressObjectState) -> dict:\n",
    "    status = \"validated\"\n",
    "    # Missing return!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ GOOD - always return a dict\n",
    "def my_node(state: AddressObjectState) -> dict:\n",
    "    status = \"validated\"\n",
    "    return {\"status\": status}  # Must return dict\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error 3: Node name mismatch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ValueError: Node 'validate' not found in graph\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Node name in set_entry_point() doesn't match add_node()\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ BAD - names don't match\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"validate_node\", validate_function)\n",
    "graph.set_entry_point(\"validate\")  # Wrong name!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ GOOD - names must match exactly\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"validate\", validate_function)\n",
    "graph.set_entry_point(\"validate\")  # Same name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error 4: Forgot to compile\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "AttributeError: 'StateGraph' object has no attribute 'invoke'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** Trying to invoke the graph before compiling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ BAD - invoking uncompiled graph\n",
    "graph = StateGraph(AddressObjectState)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"validate\", my_function)\n",
    "result = graph.invoke({\"name\": \"test\"})  # Error!\n",

    "app = graph.compile()  # Compile to create runnable\n",
    "result = app.invoke({\"name\": \"test\"})  # Now works!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error 5: Missing state fields in invoke()\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "KeyError: 'status'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cause:** invoke() doesn't include all state fields\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ BAD - missing 'status' field\n",
    "result = app.invoke({\"name\": \"web_server\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ GOOD - include all TypedDict fields\n",
    "result = app.invoke({\"name\": \"web_server\", \"status\": \"\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error 6: SCM-Specific Exceptions (Coming in Later Notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you start working with actual SCM API calls** (Notebooks 104+), you'll encounter these specific exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scm.exceptions import (\n",
    "    InvalidObjectError,       # Configuration data format is wrong\n",
    "    NameNotUniqueError,       # Object name already exists in SCM\n",
    "    ObjectNotPresentError,    # Object not found (404)\n",
    "    MissingQueryParameterError,  # Required parameter missing (e.g., folder)\n",
    "    ReferenceNotZeroError,    # Can't delete - object is referenced elsewhere\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common SCM Error Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Handling SCM exceptions in a node\n",
    "def create_address_node(state: AddressState) -> dict:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Create address object with proper error handling.\"\"\"\n",
    "    try:\n",

    "            \"folder\": \"Texas\"\n",
    "        })\n",
    "        return {\"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"Address created\"}\n",
    "        \n",
    "    except NameNotUniqueError:\n",
    "        # Address name already exists - can't create duplicate\n",
    "        return {\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": \"Address name already exists\"}\n",
    "        \n",
    "    except InvalidObjectError as e:\n",
    "        # Configuration format is wrong (invalid IP, missing required field, etc.)\n",
    "        return {\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": f\"Invalid configuration: {e.message}\"}\n",
    "        \n",
    "    except MissingQueryParameterError:\n",
    "        # Forgot required parameter like folder\n",

    "        # Catch-all for network issues, auth failures, etc.\n",
    "        return {\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": f\"Unexpected error: {str(e)}\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notebooks 104-107**: You'll implement actual SCM operations and need these exception handlers\n",
    "- **Production Workflows**: Robust error handling prevents workflows from crashing\n",
    "- **State-Based Error Tracking**: Errors are captured in state, allowing graphs to route to retry/recovery nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preview: Error Handling in Multi-Node Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Notebook 106 (Conditional Routing), you'll use exception handling with conditional edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def create_with_error_handling(state):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        client.address.create(state[\"config\"])\n",
    "        return {\"status\": \"success\"}\n",
    "    except NameNotUniqueError:\n",
    "        return {\"status\": \"duplicate\"}  # Routes to \"update\" node instead\n",
    "    except InvalidObjectError:\n",
    "        return {\"status\": \"invalid\"}    # Routes to \"fix_config\" node\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conditional edge routes based on status\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "    \"create\",\n",
    "    lambda state: state[\"status\"],\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"success\": \"verify\",\n",
    "        \"duplicate\": \"update_existing\",\n",
    "        \"invalid\": \"fix_config\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Pro Tip**: Always wrap SCM API calls in try-catch blocks and update state with error details. This allows your graph to make intelligent routing decisions!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Print state values** inside node functions:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def my_node(state: AddressObjectState) -> dict:\n",
    "       print(f\"DEBUG: Current state = {state}\")\n",
    "       # ... rest of function\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check graph structure** with visualization:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test nodes independently** before adding to graph:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   test_state = {\"name\": \"test\", \"status\": \"\"}\n",
    "   result = validate_address_object(test_state)\n",
    "   print(f\"Node returns: {result}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify TypedDict fields** match everywhere:\n",
    "   - State definition\n",
    "   - invoke() input\n",
    "   - Node function return values\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test SCM operations with try-catch** (when you get to those notebooks):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = client.address.create(config)\n",
    "       print(f\"✅ Success: {result.id}\")\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"❌ Error: {type(e).__name__}: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Pro Tip**: When stuck, go back to basics - check each component individually!"

    "## 6. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've just built your very first LangGraph application! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defined State Structure**\n",
    "   - Created `AddressObjectState` using TypedDict\n",
    "   - Defined `name` and `status` fields to track address object information\n",
    "   - Learned that state is just a class inheriting from TypedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Created a Node Function**\n",
    "   - Built `validate_address_object` as a standard Python function\n",
    "   - Learned nodes take state as input and return partial state updates\n",
    "   - Practiced using docstrings (important for AI agents later!)\n",
    "   - Understood partial state updates vs full state replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Built the Graph**\n",
    "   - Created a StateGraph with our state schema\n",
    "   - Added a node with a name and action\n",
    "   - Connected START → node → END using set_entry_point and set_finish_point\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compiled and Executed**\n",
    "   - Compiled the graph into a runnable application\n",
    "   - Visualized the graph structure using IPython mermaid diagrams\n",
    "   - Invoked the graph with initial address object state\n",
    "   - Saw how data flows through: input → node processing → output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **State** = Shared data structure (TypedDict class) tracking workflow information  \n",
    "✅ **Node** = Python function that processes state and returns updates  \n",
    "✅ **Graph** = StateGraph that manages the flow of execution  \n",
    "✅ **Compile** = Creates executable application from graph definition  \n",
    "✅ **Invoke** = Runs the graph with initial state values  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pattern You'll Use Again and Again\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Define state\n",
    "class AddressState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    name: str\n",
    "    status: str\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Create node\n",
    "def validate_address(state: AddressState) -> dict:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Validate address object configuration.\"\"\"\n",
    "    status = f\"Address '{state['name']}' is valid\"\n",
    "    return {\"status\": status}\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Build graph\n",
    "graph = StateGraph(AddressState)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"validate\", validate_address)\n",
    "graph.set_entry_point(\"validate\")\n",
    "graph.set_finish_point(\"validate\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Compile and run\n",
    "app = graph.compile()\n",
    "result = app.invoke({\"name\": \"web_server\", \"status\": \"\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple pattern you just learned applies to real SCM automation workflows:\n",
    "- **Configuration validation**: Check address object, security rule, and policy settings\n",
    "- **Compliance auditing**: Verify configurations meet security standards\n",
    "- **Pre-deployment checks**: Validate configurations before pushing to production\n",
    "- **Object creation workflows**: Validate and create SCM objects programmatically\n",
    "- **Batch operations**: Process multiple configurations systematically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: Don't worry if you didn't get 100% of everything - that's what the exercise is for! Practice solidifies understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Pro Tip**: The pattern you just learned (state → node → graph → compile → invoke) is the foundation for ALL LangGraph applications, no matter how complex. Even sophisticated SCM automation workflows with AI agents follow this exact same pattern!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've mastered the basics of single-node graphs, you're ready to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook 104**: Multi-Node Graphs and Sequential Workflows\n",
    "- Build graphs with multiple nodes (multi-step workflows)\n",
    "- Learn how to chain nodes together sequentially\n",
    "- Handle more complex state management across multiple processing steps\n",
    "- Apply these patterns to real SCM workflows like address object creation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coming in later notebooks**:\n",
    "- Add conditional routing (decision logic) with conditional edges\n",
    "- Create looping workflows with retry logic\n",
    "- Integrate tools and external APIs (actual SCM API calls)\n",
    "- Eventually, build AI agents with LLMs that automate SCM operations!\n",
    "\n",
    "Great work completing this foundation! See you in Notebook 104! 🚀\n"
