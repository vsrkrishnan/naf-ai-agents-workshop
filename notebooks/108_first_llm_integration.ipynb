    "# 108 LangGraph: Your First LLM Integration (Simple Bot)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop**: LangGraph 108\n",
    "**Duration**: ~30 minutes\n",
    "**Difficulty**: Intermediate\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Integrate an LLM (Large Language Model) into your LangGraph workflows\n",
    "- Define state structures for handling AI messages\n",
    "- Initialize and invoke Anthropic's Claude models using LangChain\n",
    "- Build a simple AI bot for PAN-OS firewall queries\n",
    "- Understand the difference between a simple bot and a true conversational agent\n",
    "- Discover the limitations of stateless AI interactions (no memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Knowledge**: Completed notebooks 101-107 (Type Annotations, Core Concepts, Graph Patterns)\n",
    "- **Setup**: Anthropic API key\n",
    "- **Cost**: Very minimal - Claude Haiku costs pennies per 1000 tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: This notebook introduces LLM integration after mastering graph patterns in notebooks 103-107. If you haven't completed those notebooks, please go back and work through the graph pattern foundations first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a **Simple PAN-OS AI Bot** that can answer questions about firewall operations, upgrades, and configurations. However, it won't remember previous messages in the conversation - and that's intentional! This limitation will motivate the next notebook where we add memory.\n",

    "```\n",
    "START → process_query → END\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your **first LLM-integrated LangGraph agent**! This is an exciting milestone in your workshop journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We're Building\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebooks 103-107, we built LangGraph workflows without any AI. We learned:\n",
    "- How to define state structures (103-104)\n",
    "- How to create nodes and connect them (103)\n",
    "- Sequential workflows, conditional routing, and loops (105-107)\n",
    "\n",
    "But we haven't actually integrated an **LLM (Large Language Model)** yet. That changes today!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Simple Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "We're building what I call a **Simple Bot** - a basic LLM wrapper that can:\n",
    "- Accept questions about PAN-OS firewalls\n",
    "- Send those questions to an AI model (Claude)\n",
    "- Return intelligent responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why \"Simple\" Bot?\n",
    "\n",
    "This bot has a critical limitation: **it has no memory**. Each question is treated independently, with no context from previous messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine asking:\n",
    "1. \"My firewall is fw-prod-01\"\n",
    "2. \"What's the hostname of my firewall?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot won't remember you just told it! This limitation is intentional - it'll motivate the next notebook where we add conversation memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Even without memory, a simple bot is useful for:\n",
    "- One-off firewall configuration queries\n",
    "- Upgrade path recommendations\n",
    "- Quick command syntax lookups\n",
    "- Policy best practices\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Setup and Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important: LangChain + LangGraph Together\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering: \"Wait, I thought we were learning LangGraph, why are we importing LangChain libraries?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Great question! Here's the key insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph is built on top of LangChain**. LangChain provides sophisticated, robust libraries for working with LLMs, and LangGraph leverages these strengths. Think of it as:\n",
    "- **LangChain**: Tools for working with LLMs (models, messages, prompts)\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: Framework for orchestrating LLMs into multi-step workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "They work together beautifully!\n",
    "\n",
    "### About API Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "We need an API key because we're making calls to an external LLM service (Anthropic). If you were using a local LLM (like through Ollama), you wouldn't need an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll store the API key in a `.env` file for security - never hardcode API keys in your notebooks!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about cost! Claude Haiku is extremely cheap:\n",
    "- Input: ~$0.25 per 1 million tokens\n",
    "- Output: ~$1.25 per 1 million tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop, you'll spend pennies at most."

    "3. **Conversation History**: Easy to track who said what in multi-turn conversations\n",
    "4. **Consistency**: Works across different LLM providers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Types in LangChain\n",
    "\n",

    "- **HumanMessage**: From the user to the AI\n",

    "\n",
    "When calling external APIs like Anthropic, things can go wrong:\n",
    "- **Network failures**: Connection drops, timeouts\n",
    "- **API errors**: Rate limits, invalid API keys, service outages  \n",
    "- **Invalid responses**: Malformed data, unexpected formats\n",

    "### Common LLM API Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Invalid API Key**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: 401 Unauthorized - Invalid API key\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fix: Check your `.env` file and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Rate Limiting**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: 429 Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fix: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (like notebook 107!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Network Failures**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: ConnectionError - Failed to reach API\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fix: Check internet connection, retry after delay\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Timeout**\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 8. The Memory Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's discover the critical limitation of our simple bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Try this sequence of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First message:** \"My firewall hostname is fw-prod-01\"\n",
    "2. **Second message:** \"What is my firewall's hostname?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot will respond with something like: \"I don't have information about your firewall's hostname.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** Because our bot has **no memory**. Each question is processed independently with no context from previous messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at our `process_query` node:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def process_query(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:\n",
    "    messages = state[\"messages\"]\n",
    "    response = llm.invoke(messages)\n",
    "    # We print the response but DON'T save it to state!\n",
    "    return state  # State unchanged - no memory of the conversation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:** We never update the state with:\n",
    "- The AI's response\n",
    "- The conversation history\n",
    "- Any context from previous messages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "For real-world PAN-OS automation, you need:\n",
    "- Multi-turn troubleshooting conversations\n",
    "- Context-aware recommendations\n",
    "- Ability to reference previous messages\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution (Coming Next!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll learn about:\n",
    "- **Conversation memory**: Storing message history\n",
    "- **State reducers**: The `Annotated[list, add_messages]` pattern\n",
    "- **True conversational agents**: Bots that remember context\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now, you've successfully integrated an LLM into LangGraph - that's a huge milestone!"

    "## 9. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "🎉 **Congratulations!** You've built your first AI-powered LangGraph agent!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrated an LLM** - Connected Anthropic's Claude to our graph\n",
    "2. **Used HumanMessage** - Learned how LangChain structures messages\n",
    "3. **Built a Simple Bot** - Created a single-node graph with AI capabilities\n",
    "4. **Tested with PAN-OS Queries** - Asked real firewall questions\n",
    "5. **Discovered the Memory Problem** - Learned why stateless bots are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **LangChain + LangGraph Work Together**\n",
    "   - LangChain: LLM tools (ChatAnthropic, messages)\n",
    "   - LangGraph: Workflow orchestration (graphs, nodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **HumanMessage Objects**\n",
    "   - Structured way to represent user messages\n",
    "   - Better than plain strings for conversation management\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **The invoke() Pattern**\n",
    "   - `llm.invoke()`: Call the LLM\n",
    "   - `agent.invoke()`: Run the graph\n",
    "   - Consistent naming across LangChain/LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **State Management**\n",
    "   - Defined `AgentState` with `List[HumanMessage]`\n",
    "   - State flows through the graph like before\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **The Memory Problem**\n",
    "   - Simple bots don't remember previous messages\n",
    "   - Each query is independent\n",
    "   - This motivates the next notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though our bot lacks memory, you've learned the fundamental pattern for integrating LLMs into LangGraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Define state with messages\n",
    "class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: List[HumanMessage]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Initialize LLM\n",
    "llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Create node that invokes LLM\n",
    "def process(state):\n",
    "    response = llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])\n",
    "    return state\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Build graph as usual\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"process\", process)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is the foundation for ALL LLM agents in LangGraph!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Use Cases (Without Memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even simple bots are useful for:\n",
    "- **One-off queries**: \"What's the CLI command for X?\"\n",
    "- **Quick lookups**: \"What does error code Y mean?\"\n",
    "- **Documentation search**: \"How do I configure Z?\"\n",
    "- **Best practices**: \"What's the recommended approach for X?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook (**109: Conversational Memory**), we'll learn:\n",
    "- How to add **conversation memory**\n",
    "- The `Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage]` **pattern**\n",
    "- **Multi-turn conversations** with context\n",
    "- **AIMessage** for storing LLM responses\n",
    "- Building **true conversational agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Our complete simple bot in ~25 lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# State\n",
    "class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: List[HumanMessage]\n",
