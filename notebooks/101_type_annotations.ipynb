    "## 1. Why TypedDict Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Demo Focus**: Instructor will demonstrate TypedDict essentials. Students observe and follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Python dictionaries are flexible but don't enforce structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is valid Python but has wrong data types!\n",
    "config = {\n",
    "    \"hostname\": \"router-01\",\n",
    "    \"mgmt_ip\": 192168001001,  # Should be string, not int!\n",
    "    \"interfaces\": \"24\"  # Should be int, not string!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In network automation, configuration errors have serious consequences:\n",
    "- ❌ Wrong IP format → Device becomes unreachable\n",
    "- ❌ Invalid data type → Automation script fails mid-deployment\n",
    "- ❌ Missing required field → API rejects the request\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: TypedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "TypedDict adds type safety to dictionaries by defining a schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "class DeviceConfig(TypedDict):\n",
    "    hostname: str\n",
    "    mgmt_ip: str\n",
    "    interfaces: int\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now your IDE will warn you about type mismatches **before** you run the code!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical concept**: Every LangGraph application uses TypedDict to define **state** - the data that flows through your graph nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see this pattern constantly:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    \"\"\"State schema for your LangGraph agent\"\"\"\n",
    "    user_input: str\n",
    "    config_name: str\n",
    "    validation_status: str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. TypedDict for Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a TypedDict?\n",
    "\n",
    "TypedDict is a way to define a schema for dictionaries by explicitly declaring what keys should exist and what data type each value should be. It's implemented as a class, which makes it easy to reuse and provides excellent IDE support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Explicitly define what data types should be in your data structure, reducing runtime errors\n",
    "- **Enhanced Readability**: Makes code self-documenting - anyone can see exactly what structure is expected\n",
    "- **Better Debugging**: When something goes wrong, it's much easier to identify type mismatches\n",
    "- **Critical for LangGraph**: TypedDict is used extensively in LangGraph to define state schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "TypedDict is implemented as a class that inherits from `TypedDict`. Inside the class, you declare each key and its expected type using type annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why TypedDict Matters for LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is extremely important**: TypedDict is used extensively in LangGraph to define the state that flows through your graph nodes. Every LangGraph application you build will use TypedDict to define what data your agent can access and modify. Don't worry - we'll cover states in detail in the next notebook, but understanding TypedDict now is essential."

    "\n",
    "1. **Union Types** - Accept multiple specific types\n",
    "   - `Union[int, float]` means \"either int or float\"\n",
    "   - Provides flexibility with type safety\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optional Types** - Handle nullable values\n",
    "   - `Optional[str]` means \"either str or None\"\n",
    "   - Perfect for fields that might not be present\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Any Type** - Dynamic typing\n",
    "   - Use sparingly for truly unpredictable data\n",
    "   - Prefer specific types when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lambda Functions** - Inline operations\n",
    "   - Shortcuts with `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`\n",
    "   - Transform and process data efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real SCM Examples**\n",
    "   - Address object configurations\n",
    "   - Security rule structures\n",
    "   - Production-ready TypedDict patterns\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that you understand TypedDict, you're ready to build LangGraph applications!\n",

    "In **Notebook 102**, you'll learn:\n",
    "- **State**: Using TypedDict to define what data flows through your graph\n",
