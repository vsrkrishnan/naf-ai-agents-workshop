    "Type annotations in Python provide a way to explicitly declare the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. While Python is dynamically typed, type hints help catch bugs early, improve code documentation, and enable better IDE support. In this notebook, we'll explore the fundamental type annotations you'll use when building LangGraph applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Type Annotations Matter for Network Administrators\n",
    "\n",
    "As a network administrator, you're familiar with structured configuration formats:\n",
    "- **CLI configuration modes** require specific syntax and structure\n",
    "- **YANG models** define strict schemas for network device configuration\n",
    "- **ACLs** have precise syntax requirements (source, destination, action)\n",
    "\n",
    "Type annotations in Python serve the same purpose - they define the \"configuration schema\" for your code, ensuring data has the correct structure before you use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without proper type annotations:\n",
    "- Code is harder to understand and maintain, especially in larger projects\n",
    "- IDEs can't provide accurate autocomplete and error detection\n",
    "- Bugs related to incorrect data types are caught at runtime instead of development time\n",
    "\n",
    "With type annotations:\n",
    "- Your code becomes self-documenting with clear contracts for what types are expected\n",
    "- IDEs provide intelligent autocomplete and catch type errors before you run your code\n",
    "- Team collaboration improves as everyone understands the expected data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore:\n",
    "1. Python dictionaries and their role as flexible data containers\n",
    "2. TypedDict for defining structured dictionary schemas\n",
    "3. Union types for handling multiple possible types\n",
    "4. Optional for nullable values\n",
    "5. Any for dynamic typing when needed\n",
    "6. Lambda functions for inline operations\n",

    "## 2. Python Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is Python's built-in key-value data structure that allows you to store and retrieve data using descriptive keys instead of numeric indices. Think of it like a real dictionary where you look up a word (key) to find its definition (value).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible Structure**: Dictionaries can hold any type of data as values (strings, numbers, lists, even other dictionaries)\n",
    "- **Dynamic**: You can add, modify, or remove keys at runtime without declaring a schema upfront\n",
    "- **Unordered**: Dictionaries maintain insertion order (Python 3.7+), but are accessed by key, not position\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries use curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a dictionary for network device configuration\n",
    "device_config = {\n",
    "    \"hostname\": \"edge-router-01\",\n",
    "    \"mgmt_ip\": \"192.168.1.1\",\n",
    "    \"device_type\": \"router\",\n",
    "    \"interfaces\": 24,\n",
    "    \"uptime\": 86400\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing values\n",
    "print(device_config[\"hostname\"])  # Output: edge-router-01\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding new keys\n",
    "device_config[\"location\"] = \"datacenter-a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying values\n",
    "device_config[\"uptime\"] = 90000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths of Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are awesome for many reasons:\n",
    "- **Efficient data retrieval** based on unique keys\n",
    "- **Flexible and easy to implement** for quick prototyping\n",
    "- **Widely supported** across Python libraries and frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Plain Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there's a potential challenge: **it's difficult to ensure data has a particular structure**. This could be a huge problem in larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply: dictionaries don't check if the data is the correct data type or structure, and that could be the source of many logical errors in your project. In a large network automation workflow, this could be quite a headache to identify because it's such a small detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is valid but probably wrong!\n",
    "device_config = {\n",
    "    \"hostname\": \"edge-router-01\",\n",
    "    \"mgmt_ip\": 192168001001,  # Oops! Should be a string, not an integer\n",
    "    \"interfaces\": \"24\"  # Oops! Should be an integer, not a string\n",
    "}\n",
    "# Python won't complain, but your code might break later\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters in Network Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "In network automation, a configuration error can have serious consequences:\n",
    "- ❌ Wrong IP format → Device becomes unreachable\n",
    "- ❌ Invalid zone name → Firewall rule doesn't apply\n",
    "- ❌ Incorrect data type → Automation script fails mid-deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "TypedDict acts as a **pre-deployment validation layer**, catching these errors during development instead of in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: TypedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem is **TypedDict** (which we'll cover in the next section). TypedDict allows us to define a schema for our dictionaries, ensuring type safety while maintaining the flexibility of dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Dictionaries Matter for LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are the foundation for data structures in Python. While LangGraph uses TypedDict to define structured state schemas, TypedDict builds upon regular dictionaries. Understanding dictionaries is essential because at runtime, your typed state objects are actually dictionaries - TypedDict just adds type checking and structure on top."

    "## 3. TypedDict for Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a TypedDict?\n",
    "\n",
    "TypedDict is a way to define a schema for dictionaries by explicitly declaring what keys should exist and what data type each value should be. It's implemented as a class, which makes it easy to reuse and provides excellent IDE support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Explicitly define what data types should be in your data structure, reducing runtime errors\n",
    "- **Enhanced Readability**: Makes code self-documenting - anyone can see exactly what structure is expected\n",
    "- **Better Debugging**: When something goes wrong, it's much easier to identify type mismatches\n",
    "- **Critical for LangGraph**: TypedDict is used extensively in LangGraph to define state schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "TypedDict is implemented as a class that inherits from `TypedDict`. Inside the class, you declare each key and its expected type using type annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why TypedDict Matters for LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is extremely important**: TypedDict is used extensively in LangGraph to define the state that flows through your graph nodes. Every LangGraph application you build will use TypedDict to define what data your agent can access and modify. Don't worry - we'll cover states in detail in the next notebook, but understanding TypedDict now is essential."

    "## 4. Union and Optional Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Union?\n",
    "\n",
    "Union is a type annotation that indicates a value can be one of several different types. It provides flexibility while still maintaining type safety by explicitly declaring which types are acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points About Union\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Valid Types**: Allows a parameter or variable to accept multiple specific types\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Provides hints to catch incorrect usage - only the declared types are valid\n",
    "- **Extensively Used**: The makers of LangChain and LangGraph use Union throughout their libraries\n",
    "- **Flexible Yet Controlled**: Gives you flexibility while preventing completely wrong types\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Optional?\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional is similar to Union but specifically for values that can be either a specific type or `None`. It's syntactic sugar for `Union[Type, None]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Union**: When a value can be one of several different types (e.g., `Union[int, float]`)\n",
    "- **Optional**: When a value might be absent/None (e.g., `Optional[str]` = `Union[str, None]`)"

    "## 7. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed the Type Annotations notebook. Let's recap what you've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python Dictionaries** - Flexible key-value data structures that are the foundation for TypedDict\n",
    "   - Easy to use but lack type safety\n",
    "   - Can lead to bugs in larger projects\n",
    "   - Critical to understand for network automation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TypedDict** - Structured dictionary schemas with type safety\n",
    "   - Define exactly what keys and types are expected\n",
    "   - Critical for LangGraph state management\n",
    "   - Provides IDE autocomplete and error checking\n",
    "   - **Applied to real SCM address objects and security rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Union Types** - Accept multiple specific types\n",
    "   - `Union[int, float]` means \"either int or float\"\n",
    "   - Provides flexibility with type safety\n",
    "   - Used extensively in LangChain and LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional** - Handle nullable values\n",
    "   - `Optional[str]` means \"either str or None\"\n",
    "   - Perfect for fields that might not always be present\n",
    "   - Still type-safe - can't be any random type\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Any Type** - Accept any type whatsoever\n",
    "   - Use sparingly for truly dynamic data\n",
    "   - Prefer specific types when possible\n",
    "   - Good for external data without schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Lambda Functions** - Inline anonymous functions\n",
    "   - Shortcuts for simple operations\n",
    "   - Efficient with `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`\n",
    "   - **Used to filter and process security rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications You Built\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, you created practical, production-ready TypedDict schemas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **SCM Address Objects**: IP/Netmask, FQDN, and IP Range configurations  \n",
    "  - Reference: [docs/examples/address_objects.py](../docs/examples/address_objects.py) lines 9-15, 21-26, 32-37\n",
    "  - Ready to use with `client.address.create()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Security Rules**: Complete firewall rule structures with logging\n",
    "  - Reference: [docs/examples/security_policy.py](../docs/examples/security_policy.py) lines 9-20, 26-39\n",
    "  - Ready to use with `client.security_rule.create(rule, rulebase='pre')`\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Validation Functions**: Error-checking logic for configuration safety\n",
    "  - Demonstrated with address configuration validation\n",
    "  - Applied to security rule validation\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Lambda Processing**: Filtering rules by action, tags, and zones\n",
    "  - `filter()` to find specific rule types\n",
    "  - `map()` to extract data from rules\n",
    "  - `sorted()` to order rules by name\n",
    "  - `Counter` to analyze rule distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the exact patterns you'll use when building LangGraph workflows for Palo Alto Networks automation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "These type annotations are fundamental to building LangGraph applications:\n",
    "- **TypedDict** defines your agent's state schema\n",
    "- **Union** and **Optional** handle flexible data types\n",
    "- **Lambda** functions help transform and filter data efficiently\n",
    "- **Validation** ensures configurations are correct before API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "### Progressive Complexity Achieved\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook followed a clear learning path:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dictionaries** → Understanding the foundation\n",
    "2. **TypedDict** → Adding structure and type safety\n",
    "3. **Union/Optional** → Handling flexible types\n",
    "4. **Any** → Understanding when to use dynamic typing\n",
    "5. **Lambda** → Efficient data transformation\n",
    "6. **Real SCM Examples** → Applying everything to production use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sneak Peak: What's Next in Notebook 102\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've mastered TypedDict and SCM structures, get ready to bring them to life in LangGraph!\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Notebook 102: Core Concepts, you'll learn:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State** - Using the TypedDict patterns you just learned to define what data flows through your graph\n",
    "   - Example: `class AddressState(TypedDict): name: str, ip_netmask: str, status: str`\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Nodes** - Functions that process state (using the exact SCM patterns from this notebook!)\n",
    "   - Example: A `validate_address()` node that checks IP/netmask format\n",
    "   - Example: A `create_address()` node that calls `client.address.create()`\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Graphs** - Connecting nodes into automated workflows\n",
    "   - Example: `validate → prepare → create → verify` pipeline for address objects\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Edges** - Defining how execution flows from node to node\n",
    "   - Sequential flow: `graph.add_edge(\"validate\", \"create\")`\n",
    "   - START/END nodes for entry and exit points\n",
    "\n",
    "**You'll build your first complete LangGraph application:**\n",
    "- A 4-node graph that validates, prepares, creates, and verifies SCM address objects\n",
    "- Using the exact `AddressObjectNetmask` TypedDict from this notebook\n",
    "- Demonstrating how state accumulates data as it flows through nodes\n",
    "- Showing real pan-scm-sdk integration patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**The exciting part?** Everything you learned in this notebook transfers directly:\n",
    "- Your TypedDict schemas become LangGraph state\n",
    "- Your validation functions become graph nodes  \n",
    "- Your lambda filters become state transformations\n",
    "- Your SCM knowledge becomes production automation!\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚀 Ready to build real automation workflows? Let's move to Notebook 102!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-Assessment Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to move on to Notebook 102? Check your understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Can you explain why TypedDict is better than plain dictionaries for configuration automation?\n",
    "- [ ] Can you create a TypedDict schema with both required and Optional fields?\n",

    "- [ ] Can you write lambda functions to use with map(), filter(), and sorted()?\n",
    "- [ ] Can you build SCM address object and security rule TypedDict structures matching the pan-scm-sdk API?\n",
    "- [ ] Do you understand how to validate configurations before deployment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you checked all boxes, you're ready for Notebook 102: Core Concepts!**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unsure about any topic, review that section before continuing. These foundations are essential for LangGraph success.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Reminder\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to memorize any of this - just have a high-level understanding of what these annotations are and why they're useful. You can always refer back to this notebook when you need a refresher!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Files for Your Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "When building your own LangGraph workflows, reference these files for accurate SCM API structures:\n",
    "- **Address Objects**: [docs/examples/address_objects.py](../docs/examples/address_objects.py)\n",
    "- **Security Rules**: [docs/examples/security_policy.py](../docs/examples/security_policy.py)\n",
