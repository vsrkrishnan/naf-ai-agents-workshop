    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). At its core, LangGraph provides a graph-based approach to orchestrating workflows where data flows through nodes connected by edges. Think of it like a network diagram - but instead of routers and switches, you have processing nodes that transform state as it moves through your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the fundamental building blocks of LangGraph without worrying about LLMs or APIs. We'll focus on understanding the core concepts using simple network automation examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph Matters for Network Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a structured workflow framework:\n",
    "- Complex automation logic becomes spaghetti code with nested if/else statements\n",
    "- State management is error-prone and hard to debug\n",
    "- Adding new steps or changing workflow order requires significant refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "With LangGraph:\n",
    "- Workflows are visual and easy to understand (nodes and edges)\n",
    "- State is explicitly defined and flows predictably through the graph\n",
    "- Adding, removing, or reordering steps is as simple as modifying the graph structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll learn:\n",
    "1. How to define **State** using TypedDict (building on 101 concepts)\n",
    "2. How to create **Nodes** that process state\n",
    "3. How to construct a **Graph** and connect nodes with **Edges**\n",
    "4. How to add **Conditional Edges** for dynamic routing\n",
    "5. How to integrate **Tools** for external capabilities\n",

    "## 2. State - The Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is State?\n",
    "\n",
    "**State** is a shared data structure that holds the current information or context of your entire LangGraph application. In simpler terms, it's like your application's memory where it keeps track of variables and data that nodes can access and modify as they execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of state like the information that needs to be tracked during **SCM address object creation**. When a network administrator creates address objects in Strata Cloud Manager, they need to track multiple pieces of information throughout the process:\n",
    "- The address object name\n",
    "- IP address or FQDN value\n",
    "- Which folder to deploy to\n",
    "- Description and tags\n",
    "- Validation status\n",
    "- Whether the object was created successfully\n",
    "- Any errors encountered\n",
    "- Current step in the workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This information needs to persist and be accessible throughout the entire configuration workflow. Each task in the workflow (parsing input, validating data, creating the object in SCM) can read this information and update it. That's exactly what **State** does in LangGraph - it's the shared data that flows through your workflow, being read and updated by each step (node).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points About State\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shared Data Structure**: All nodes can access and modify the same state\n",
    "- **Application Memory**: Keeps track of variables and data throughout execution\n",
    "- **Type-Safe**: Using TypedDict ensures you know exactly what data exists\n",
    "- **Centralized**: All information your workflow needs is stored in one place\n",
    "- **Flows Through Workflow**: Each step receives state, processes it, and returns updates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why State Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "State is the backbone of your LangGraph application. Without properly defined state:\n",
    "- Each step doesn't know what information is available from previous steps\n",
    "- Type errors happen at runtime instead of development time\n",
    "- Debugging becomes difficult because data flow is unclear\n",
    "\n",
    "With well-defined state:\n",
    "- Every step knows exactly what data is available\n",
    "- IDEs provide autocomplete for state fields\n",
    "- Data flow is explicit and easy to trace\n",
    "- You can see the complete status of your workflow at any point\n",
    "\n",
    "### Progressive Complexity in State Design\n",
    "\n",
    "As you build more sophisticated workflows, your state schemas will evolve. Here's how state complexity typically progresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Level | Complexity | Fields | Example Use Case |\n",
    "|-------|-----------|--------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Level 1** | Simple (2-3 fields) | `name`, `ip_netmask`, `folder` | Basic address object creation |\n",
    "| **Level 2** | Moderate (4-6 fields) | Add: `validated`, `error_message`, `created` | With validation and tracking |\n",
    "| **Level 3** | Complex (7-10 fields) | Add: `description`, `tags`, `object_id`, `current_step` | Full lifecycle tracking |\n",
    "| **Level 4** | Advanced (10+ fields) | Add: `api_response`, `errors` (list), `metadata`, `timestamps` | Production-ready with audit trail |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**: Start at Level 1-2 for learning, move to Level 3-4 for production workflows."

    "### What is a Node?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes** are individual functions or operations that perform specific tasks within your LangGraph workflow. Each node receives an input (typically the current state), processes it, and produces an output (an updated state).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of nodes like **stages in an SCM configuration workflow**. When you create address objects in Strata Cloud Manager, you follow a series of steps:\n",
    "1. **Parse Station**: Extracts address object details from user input\n",
    "2. **Validation Station**: Validates IP formats, required fields, and folder existence\n",
    "3. **Preparation Station**: Formats data according to SCM API requirements\n",
    "4. **Creation Station**: Makes the API call to create the object in SCM\n",
    "5. **Verification Station**: Confirms the object was created and retrieves its ID\n",
    "\n",
    "Each station does one specific job. The configuration data moves through each station, and at each stage something specific happens to it. That's exactly what nodes are - each node performs one specific task in your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points About Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Functions**: Each node is a Python function with a single responsibility\n",
    "- **Receives State**: Nodes get the current state as input\n",
    "- **Processes Data**: Performs a specific operation (validation, API call, decision logic)\n",
    "- **Returns Updates**: Returns a dictionary with state updates\n",
    "- **Sequential or Parallel**: Nodes can run one after another or in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Nodes Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are where the actual work happens in your LangGraph application:\n",
    "- Each node has a clear, single responsibility (like validating input or calling the SCM API)\n",
    "- Breaking workflows into nodes makes them easier to test and debug\n",
    "- You can reuse nodes across different workflows\n",
    "- Nodes can be swapped, added, or removed without affecting others"

    "## 4. Graph and Edges - Connecting the Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is StateGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we discuss edges, let's understand **StateGraph** itself - this is one of the first and most important elements you'll interact with when building LangGraph applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**StateGraph** is the builder and compiler for your graph structure. Its main purpose is to:\n",
    "- Build and compile the graph structure\n",
    "- Manage nodes, edges, and overall state\n",
    "- Ensure the workflow operates in a unified way\n",
    "- Make sure data flows correctly between components\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of StateGraph like a **configuration management playbook template**. Just as a well-designed playbook template outlines the procedure, defines all the steps, and shows how they connect together, StateGraph defines the structure and flow of your workflow. Before you can execute configuration changes in SCM, you need the playbook. Before you can run a workflow, you need StateGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms:\n",
    "- **Playbook template** = StateGraph (defines structure)\n",
    "- **Individual tasks** = Nodes (steps in the workflow)\n",
    "- **Task dependencies** = Edges (connections between steps)\n",
    "- **Executing the playbook** = Running the compiled graph\n",
    "\n",
    "StateGraph is what ties everything together - without it, you'd just have disconnected nodes and no way to orchestrate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Edges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand StateGraph, let's talk about how nodes connect together. That's where **edges** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edges** are connections between nodes that determine the flow of execution. They tell your application which node should be executed next after the current one completes its task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of edges like **API call sequences in configuration workflows**. Imagine your SCM configuration workflow as a series of API calls that must happen in order - you can't create an address object before validating the input, and you can't verify creation before making the create call. Each step depends on the previous one completing successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangGraph:\n",
    "- The **API operations** = Nodes (validate, prepare, create, verify)\n",
    "- The **call sequence** = Edges (connections defining order)\n",
    "- The **configuration data** = State (flowing through the workflow)\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges ensure your state flows from one processing step to the next in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points About Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connections**: Link nodes together to define workflow sequence\n",
    "- **Directional**: Flow goes from one specific node to another\n",
    "- **Determine Flow**: Control which node executes next\n",
    "- **Two Types**: Simple edges (always follow the same path) and conditional edges (dynamic routing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Edges Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Without edges:\n",
    "- Nodes would be disconnected and isolated\n",
    "- You'd have to manually orchestrate the execution order\n",
    "- No way to define the workflow sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "With edges:\n",
    "- Workflow sequence is explicit and visual\n",
    "- State automatically flows from node to node\n",
    "- Easy to modify the workflow by changing edges"

    "\n",
    "Before we connect nodes with edges, let's understand two special elements: **START** and **END**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**START** is a virtual entry point in LangGraph that marks where the workflow begins. It's important to note that START doesn't perform any operations itself - it simply serves as the designated starting position for the graph's execution. Think of it like the **beginning of your configuration playbook** - it's where you open the document and start following the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**END** signifies the conclusion of the workflow in LangGraph.

    "- **Runnable** can represent various operations - it's a general execution interface\n",
    "- **Node** in LangGraph typically receives state, performs an action, and updates state\n",

Each piece has a standard interface (rack mount) and can be swapped or combined as needed.\n",

    "## 5. What's Next: Conditional Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've built workflows with **simple sequential edges** - our graphs follow a fixed path from START to END. But what if you need your workflow to make decisions and take different paths based on the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where **conditional routing** comes in! In **Notebook 103**, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add **conditional edges** that route based on state values\n",
    "- Create **router functions** that decide which path to take (like if/else logic)\n",
    "- Handle **success and error paths** differently (e.g., retry on failure, skip steps if not needed)\n",
    "- Build **intelligent workflows** that adapt based on validation results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Preview: Validation-Based Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want your workflow to handle validation failures differently than successes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Simple Edge Approach:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "START → validate → prepare → create → END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: If validation fails, we still try to prepare and create!\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Conditional Routing:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "                    ┌─ validation success ─> prepare → create → END\n",
    "START → validate ───┤\n",
    "                    └─ validation failure ──> error_handler → END\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Router Function** - Decides which path to take:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def route_after_validation(state: SCMAddressState) -> str:\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"Route based on validation results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        str: Name of the next node to execute\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"\n",
    "    if state[\"validated\"]:\n",
    "        return \"prepare\"  # Success path\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"error_handler\"  # Error path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add Conditional Edge** - Use router to choose next node:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build graph\n",
    "graph = StateGraph(SCMAddressState)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"validate\", validate_address_input)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"prepare\", prepare_scm_config)\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"error_handler\", handle_validation_error)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple edges\n",
    "graph.add_edge(START, \"validate\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# CONDITIONAL edge - chooses next node dynamically\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\n",
    "    \"validate\",  # After this node completes\n",
    "    route_after_validation,  # Call this router function\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"prepare\": \"prepare\",  # If returns \"prepare\", go to prepare node\n",
    "        \"error_handler\": \"error_handler\"  # If returns \"error_handler\", go there\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Continue with success path\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"prepare\", \"create\")\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"create\", END)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Error path ends\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"error_handler\", END)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Retry Logic on API Failure**\n",

    "        return \"retry_create\"  # Retry\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"failure_handler\"  # Give up after 3 retries\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Scenario 3: Security Policy Rule Complexity**\n",

    "def route_by_rule_complexity(state: SecurityPolicyState) -> str:\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"Route complex rules to enhanced validation.\\\"\\\"\\\"\n",

    "        return \"basic_validation\"  # Simple rule can use fast path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Conditional Routing Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of conditional routing like **network ACL logic** - matching conditions and taking different actions based on the match result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without Conditional Routing:**\n",
    "- All configurations follow the same path (even when validation fails)\n",
    "- Can't handle different address types efficiently\n",
    "- No retry logic for transient failures\n",
    "- Error handling happens too late\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Conditional Routing:**\n",
    "- Intelligent branching based on data\n",
    "- Different validation logic for different types\n",
    "- Automatic retry for temporary failures\n",
    "- Early error detection and handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Router Function**: Pure function that examines state and returns next node name\n",
    "2. **Conditional Edge**: `add_conditional_edges(source, router, mapping)`\n",
    "3. **Path Mapping**: Dictionary mapping router return values to node names\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coming in Notebook 103:** We'll integrate this with **LLM-powered decision making** to build a conversational chatbot that can:\n",
    "- Route user requests to appropriate handlers\n",
    "- Decide when to use tools vs when to respond directly\n",
    "- Handle multi-turn conversations with context\n",
    "- Make intelligent decisions based on natural language understanding\n",

    "## 6. What's Next: Tools and External Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've used simple Python functions as nodes. But what if you need your workflow to interact with external systems like:\n",
    "- Making API calls to Strata Cloud Manager\n",
    "- Validating IP addresses with advanced logic\n",
    "- Checking if folders exist in SCM\n",
    "- Creating, reading, updating, or deleting configuration objects\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where **Tools** come in! In **Notebook 106**, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create **reusable tools** with the `@tool` decorator\n",
    "- Integrate **pan-scm-sdk methods** as tools (create, list, fetch, update, delete)\n",
    "- Use **ToolNode** to execute tools within graphs\n",
    "- Build **ReAct agents** that intelligently select and use tools\n",
    "- Enable **LLMs to call tools** based on natural language requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Distinction: Nodes vs Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes** are workflow orchestration functions:\n",
    "- Control the flow of your graph\n",
    "- Update state based on current values\n",
    "- Make decisions about what happens next\n",
    "- Part of your graph structure (added with `add_node()`)\n",
    "- Example: A validation node that checks data and routes to success or error paths\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** are reusable operations:\n",
    "- Perform specific external operations (API calls, database queries, calculations)\n",
    "- Can be called dynamically by LLM agents\n",
    "- Not part of the graph structure (passed to agents or ToolNode)\n",
    "- Decorated with `@tool` to enable LLM usage\n",
    "- Example: A tool that creates an address object via `client.address.create()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Analogy:**\n",
    "Think of nodes like **managers** who coordinate work, and tools like **specialists** who do specific technical tasks. The manager (node) decides *when* to use a specialist, but the specialist (tool) has the expertise to actually perform the technical operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Preview: pan-scm-sdk Methods as Tools\n",
    "\n",

    "### How Tools Integrate with Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Notebook 106**, you'll learn to use these tools in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. ToolNode in Graphs:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a list of tools\n",
    "scm_tools = [\n",
    "    create_address_object,\n",
    "    list_address_objects,\n",
    "    fetch_address_object\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add ToolNode to graph\n",
    "graph.add_node(\"tools\", ToolNode(scm_tools))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to tools\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"agent\", \"tools\")\n",
    "graph.add_edge(\"tools\", \"agent\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. ReAct Agents with Tools:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent\n",
    "\n",
    "# Agent can intelligently select and use tools\n",
    "agent = create_react_agent(\n",
    "    model=llm,\n",
    "    tools=scm_tools,\n",
    "    state_schema=SCMAddressState\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Agent decides which tool to use based on user request\n",
    "result = agent.invoke({\n",
    "    \"messages\": [\"Create an address object named web-srv with IP 10.1.1.100/32 in Texas folder\"]\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coming in Notebook 106:** You'll build autonomous agents that can:\n",
    "- Understand natural language requests\n",
    "- Select the appropriate SCM tool automatically\n",
    "- Execute complex multi-step operations\n",
    "- Handle errors and retry with different approaches\n",
    "\n",

    "## 7. Messages in LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "> **📘 Preview Note**: This section introduces Messages as a preview for **Notebook 103** where you'll integrate LLMs into your workflows. Messages aren't required for the basic automation workflows in this notebook, but understanding them now will prepare you for building AI-powered agents in the next notebooks!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Messages?\n",
    "\n",
    "When building LangGraph applications that interact with Large Language Models (LLMs), you'll work with different types of **messages**. If you're coming from a LangChain background, you'll be quite familiar with these. If not, don't worry - we'll cover the five most common message types in LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Messages are how you communicate with LLMs in a structured way. Think of them like **different types of firewall logs** - each has a specific format and purpose:\n",
    "- **Traffic logs** = Different information than threat logs\n",
    "- **System logs** = Different from configuration logs\n",
    "- Each log type has its specific structure and use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, each message type in LangGraph serves a specific purpose in your AI workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Five Common Message Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HumanMessage** - Represents input from a user\n",
    "   - Like a **ticket from a network engineer**: \"Check the HA status of fw01\"\n",
    "   - This is what the user wants the AI to do\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **AIMessage** - Represents responses generated by AI models  \n",
    "   - Like the **AI's response**: \"I've checked fw01. HA is active and synced.\"\n",
    "   - This is what the AI says back\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SystemMessage** - Used to provide instructions or context to the model\n",
    "   - Like **standard operating procedures**: \"You are a PAN-OS firewall expert. Always check HA before upgrades.\"\n",
    "   - Sets the behavior and context for the AI\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ToolMessage** - Specific to tool usage, contains results from tool execution\n",
    "   - Like **command output**: The result from running `show high-availability state`\n",
    "   - Contains actual data returned by tools\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **FunctionMessage** - Represents the result of a function call (similar to ToolMessage)\n",
    "   - Like **API response data**: The JSON returned from a PAN-OS API call\n",
    "   - Contains structured data from function executions\n",
    "\n",
    "### When You'll Use Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've used LLM APIs before (like OpenAI's API or Anthropic's Claude API), you'll recognize HumanMessage, AIMessage, and SystemMessage - they're fundamental to conversational AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our SCM address object workflow examples, we didn't use messages because we weren't interacting with an LLM. But in a more advanced workflow where an AI agent makes decisions about configurations, you'd use:\n",
    "- **SystemMessage**: \"You are an SCM configuration specialist...\"\n",
    "- **HumanMessage**: \"Create an address object for web-server 10.1.1.100/32 in Texas folder\"\n",
    "- **AIMessage**: \"I'll parse and validate the input first...\"\n",
    "- **ToolMessage**: Results from validating IP format, checking folder existence, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Messages are essential when building **conversational** or **agent-based** workflows with LLMs. For now, just know they exist and understand their purposes. You'll use them extensively when we add LLM agents to our workflows in **Notebook 103**!\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Coming in Notebook 103**: You'll see Messages in action when we build an LLM-powered agent that can:\n",
    "- Understand natural language requests for SCM configurations\n",
    "- Use tools dynamically based on the request\n",
    "- Provide conversational responses about configuration status\n",
    "- Make intelligent decisions about which workflow path to follow"

    "Now that you've learned the core concepts, it's time to put them into practice! These exercises will reinforce your understanding and prepare you for more advanced notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Build a 3-Node Address Object Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Create a complete parse → validate → format workflow for address objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. Define an `AddressObjectState` TypedDict with fields:\n",
    "   - `raw_input`: str (user's text input)\n",
    "   - `name`: str (parsed object name)\n",
    "   - `ip_netmask`: str (parsed IP/netmask)\n",
    "   - `folder`: str (parsed folder name)\n",
    "   - `validated`: bool (validation status)\n",
    "   - `error_message`: str (error details if validation fails)\n",
    "   - `api_ready_config`: dict (final SCM API configuration)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create three nodes:\n",
    "   - `parse_input`: Extract name, IP/netmask, folder from raw input\n",
    "   - `validate_address`: Validate IP format and required fields\n",
    "   - `format_for_api`: Create API-ready configuration matching docs/examples/address_objects.py\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Build a StateGraph:\n",
    "   - Add all three nodes\n",
    "   - Connect with simple edges: START → parse → validate → format → END\n",
    "   - Compile and test with valid and invalid inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria**:\n",
    "- Valid input produces complete API-ready configuration\n",
    "- Invalid input is caught by validation and reported in error_message\n",
    "- State flows correctly through all nodes\n",
    "- Graph visualization shows clean pipeline structure\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Security Policy State Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Design a TypedDict for security policy creation workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. Create a `SecurityPolicyState` TypedDict with fields for:\n",
    "   - **Input**: name, description\n",
    "   - **Zones**: from_zones (list), to_zones (list)\n",
    "   - **Addresses**: source (list), destination (list)\n",
    "   - **Application**: application (list)\n",
    "   - **Action**: action (str - \"allow\", \"deny\", or \"drop\")\n",
    "   - **Tracking**: validated (bool), created (bool), errors (list)\n",
    "   - **Output**: api_ready_config (dict)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a validation node that checks:\n",
    "   - Name is provided and non-empty\n",
    "   - At least one from_zone and one to_zone\n",
    "   - At least one source and one destination\n",
    "   - Action is one of: \"allow\", \"deny\", \"drop\"\n",
    "   - Returns validation status and any errors\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test the validation node with various inputs:\n",
    "   - Complete valid policy\n",
    "   - Missing name\n",
    "   - Invalid action\n",
    "   - Missing zones\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria**:\n",

    "### Exercise 3: Add Error Handling Node\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Extend Exercise 1 with error detection and handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. Take your Exercise 1 solution\n",
    "2. Add an `error_handler` node that:\n",
    "   - Receives state with validation errors\n",
    "   - Formats error message for user\n",
    "   - Logs error details\n",
    "   - Sets current_step to \"failed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modify the workflow:\n",
    "   - Keep: START → parse → validate → format → END (success path)\n",
    "   - The format node should check if `validated` is True\n",
    "   - If validated is False, format node should set final state indicating failure\n",
    "   - Error information should be preserved in state\n",

    "- Parse → Validate → Format pipeline\n",
    "- State accumulates through nodes\n",
    "- Each node has single responsibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Level 3 - State Transformations:**\n",
    "- Add complex field validations (IP octet ranges, CIDR limits)\n",
    "- Data type conversions (string lists to arrays)\n",
    "- Conditional updates based on address_type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Level 4 - Visualization:**\n",
    "- Implement all of Level 3\n",
    "- Add graph visualization with draw_mermaid_png()\n",
    "- Add state logging at each node\n",
    "- Add comprehensive error messages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria**:\n",
    "- Each level works correctly\n",
    "- Progression shows increasing complexity\n",
    "- Level 4 is production-ready quality\n",
    "- You understand trade-offs between levels\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Simple**: Get Level 1 working before moving to Level 2\n",
    "2. **Test Frequently**: Run your nodes independently before connecting in graph\n",
    "3. **Visualize**: Always use `draw_mermaid_png()` to see your graph structure\n",
    "4. **Reference Examples**: Look at the complete examples in this notebook\n",
    "5. **Check State**: Print state at each node to verify data flow\n",
    "6. **Error First**: Test error cases before success cases\n",

    "## 9. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed the LangGraph Core Concepts notebook. Let's recap what you've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State - The Foundation**\n",
    "   - Shared data structure that flows through your workflow\n",
    "   - Defined using TypedDict for type safety\n",
    "   - Like tracking information during SCM address object creation (name, IP, folder, validation status)\n",
    "   - Each node can read and update state\n",
    "   - Progressive complexity levels: Simple (2-3 fields) → Advanced (10+ fields)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nodes - Processing Units**\n",
    "   - Individual functions that perform specific tasks\n",
    "   - Like stages in a configuration workflow (parse, validate, format)\n",
    "   - Receive state as input, return partial state updates\n",
    "   - Each node has a single, clear responsibility\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **StateGraph - The Builder**\n",
    "   - Builds and compiles your graph structure\n",
    "   - Manages nodes, edges, and state flow\n",
    "   - Like a configuration playbook template that defines the entire procedure\n",
    "   - First component you interact with when building workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Edges - Connections**\n",
    "   - Link nodes together to define workflow sequence\n",
    "   - Like API call sequences in configuration workflows\n",
    "   - Determine which node executes next\n",
    "   - Simple edges follow a fixed path (START → node1 → node2 → END)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **START and END - Entry and Exit Points**\n",
    "   - START: Virtual entry point where workflow begins\n",
    "   - END: Exit point where workflow completes\n",
    "   - Not real nodes, just markers for execution boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Conditional Routing - Preview**\n",
    "   - Make routing decisions based on state (covered in Notebook 103)\n",
    "   - Like if/else logic or network ACL rules\n",
    "   - Enable workflows to handle success/failure paths differently\n",
    "   - Coming in Notebook 103: LLM-powered conditional routing\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Tools - Preview**\n",
    "   - Reusable operations for external capabilities (covered in Notebook 106)\n",
    "   - Like pan-scm-sdk methods: create(), list(), fetch(), update(), delete()\n",
    "   - Different from nodes: tools do work, nodes orchestrate workflow\n",
    "   - Coming in Notebook 106: ReAct agents that intelligently select and use tools\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Runnable - Execution Interface**\n",
    "   - Standardized executable component\n",
    "   - What you get when you compile a StateGraph\n",
    "   - Like modular rack-mounted equipment - standard interface, swappable\n",
    "   - Invoke it with initial state to execute your workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Messages - LLM Communication**\n",
    "   - Five types: Human, AI, System, Tool, Function\n",
    "   - Used in conversational/agent-based workflows with LLMs\n",
    "   - Not needed for simple automation, essential for AI agents\n",
    "   - Coming in Notebook 103: Using Messages for conversational workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Hands-On Exercises**\n",
    "    - Exercise 1: Build a 3-node address object pipeline\n",
    "    - Exercise 2: Design security policy state schema\n",
    "    - Exercise 3: Add error handling\n",
    "    - Bonus: Progressive complexity levels (1-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Network Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "These core concepts are the foundation for building intelligent network automation workflows:\n",
    "- **State** tracks your SCM configurations, validation results, creation progress\n",
    "- **Nodes** represent automation tasks (parse input, validate data, format for API)\n",
    "- **Edges** define your automation sequence\n",
    "- **Conditional Edges** (Notebook 103) handle different scenarios (success vs failure)\n",
    "- **Tools** (Notebook 106) interact with your infrastructure (SCM API calls)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Built\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you created:\n",
    "- ✅ Complete SCM address object creation workflow (validate → prepare → create → verify)\n",
    "- ✅ Simple 3-node pipeline (parse → validate → format)\n",
    "- ✅ State schemas for address objects with progressive complexity\n",
    "- ✅ Graph visualizations showing workflow structure\n",
    "- ✅ Error handling and validation patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand LangGraph fundamentals, you're ready to:\n",
    "1. **Notebook 103**: Add conditional routing and LLM integration for intelligent decision-making\n",
    "2. **Notebook 106**: Integrate real SCM API calls using pan-scm-sdk as tools\n",
    "3. Build more complex workflows with multiple conditional paths\n",
    "4. Implement error handling and retry logic\n",
    "5. Create production-ready automation workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Reminder\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to memorize every detail - just understand how these components work together:\n",
    "- **State** flows through **Nodes** connected by **Edges**\n",
    "- **StateGraph** builds the workflow, compiles to a **Runnable**\n",
    "- **Tools** provide reusable operations (coming in Notebook 106)\n",
    "- **Messages** enable LLM interaction (coming in Notebook 103)\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn is by building! Try the hands-on exercises, then move on to Notebook 103 where you'll add conditional routing and LLM-powered decision making.\n",
