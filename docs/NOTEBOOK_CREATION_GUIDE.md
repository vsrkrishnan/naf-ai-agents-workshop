# Verify API key is configured
api_key = os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')

if not api_key:
    print("❌ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found")
    print("\n🔧 Fix:")
    print("   1. Copy .env.template to .env")
    print("   2. Add your API key to .env")
    print("   3. Restart this notebook")
elif not api_key.startswith('sk-ant-api03-'):
    print("⚠️  API key format looks incorrect")
    print("   Should start with: sk-ant-api03-")
else:
    print("✅ API key configured")
    print(f"   Key preview: {api_key[:20]}...")

# Initialize client

```

**Cell N+2** (Code):

```python
# Define your example
# Include detailed comments explaining each step

# Example structure:
class YourState(TypedDict):
    """State schema for this example."""
    field1: str  # What this field represents
    field2: int  # What this field represents

def your_node(state: YourState) -> dict:
    """
    Brief description of what this node does.

    Args:
        state: Current state

    Returns:
        Updated state
    """
    # Implementation with comments
    result = do_something(state)
    return {"field1": result}

# Build graph
graph = StateGraph(YourState)
graph.add_node("node_name", your_node)
graph.add_edge(START, "node_name")
graph.add_edge("node_name", END)

# Compile
app = graph.compile()

print("✅ Example created successfully")
```

**Run**: `Shift + Enter`

---

#### Step 9: Visualize the Example

**Cell N+3** (Markdown):

```markdown
Let's visualize the graph structure:
```

**Cell N+4** (Code):

print("- Blue boxes: Processing nodes")
print("- Arrows: Flow direction")
```

**Run**: `Shift + Enter`

---

#### Step 10: Run and Demonstrate

**Cell N+5** (Markdown):

```markdown
Now let's run it and see the results:
```

**Cell N+6** (Code):

```python
# Execute the graph
print("Running example...\n")

result = app.invoke({
    "field1": "initial_value",
    "field2": 0
})

print("📊 Results:")
pprint(result)

# Validate results

## Common Notebook Patterns

### Pattern 1: State Definition

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class MyState(TypedDict):
    """Clear docstring explaining this state."""
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]  # Message history
    user_info: dict  # User context
    counter: int  # Some metric
```

### Pattern 2: Node Function

```python
def my_node(state: MyState) -> dict:
    """
    One-line description of what this node does.

    Args:
        state: Current graph state

    Returns:
        Dictionary with state updates
    """
    # Process state
    result = process(state)

    # Return updates (not full state)
    return {"field": result}
```

### Pattern 3: Graph Construction

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Create graph
graph = StateGraph(MyState)

# Add nodes
graph.add_node("node1", node1_function)
graph.add_node("node2", node2_function)

# Add edges
graph.add_edge(START, "node1")
graph.add_edge("node1", "node2")
graph.add_edge("node2", END)

# Compile
app = graph.compile()
```

### Pattern 4: Visualization

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

# Show graph structure
display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

### Pattern 5: Execution with Output

```python
# Run the graph
print("Executing graph...\n")
result = app.invoke({"initial": "state"})

# Display results
print("📊 Results:")
pprint(result)

# Validate
assert "expected_field" in result
print("\n✅ Success!")
```
