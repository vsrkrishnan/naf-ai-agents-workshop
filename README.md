## 🔑 Key Patterns

### Essential LangGraph Patterns You'll Master

#### 1. Basic Graph (Notebook 103)

```python
graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("process", process_function)
graph.set_entry_point("process")
graph.set_finish_point("process")
app = graph.compile()
```

#### 2. Sequential Pipeline (Notebook 105)

```python
graph.add_edge(START, "validate")
graph.add_edge("validate", "create")
graph.add_edge("create", "verify")
graph.add_edge("verify", END)
```

#### 3. Conditional Routing (Notebook 106)

```python
graph.add_node("router", lambda state: state)
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    source="router",
    path=router_function,
    path_map={"path_a": "node_a", "path_b": "node_b"}
)
```

#### 4. Looping (Notebook 107)

```python
def should_continue(state) -> Literal["loop", "exit"]:
    if state["counter"] >= state["max"]:
        return "exit"  # Safety!
    return "loop"

graph.add_conditional_edges("check", should_continue,
    {"loop": "process", "exit": END})
```

#### 5. ReAct Agent (Notebook 110)

```python
messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]

@tool
def my_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Docstring critical for LLM!"""
    return result

model_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([my_tool])
```

#### 6. Human-in-the-Loop (Notebook 111)

```python
def should_continue(state):
    if save_tool_called:
        return END
    return "agent"  # Continue feedback loop
```
